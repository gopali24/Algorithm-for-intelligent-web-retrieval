0,"Feel like life is over because I complimented younger friends. Please help me. This is one of the worst anxiety spikes I've ever had in my life, and I really need guidance and some perspective on why my life isn't over.

I'm a woman in my 20s with OCD, panic disorder, and PTSD. I've worried my whole life about accidentally breaking the law, being a creep without knowing, or just generally doing something bad without knowing at the time and then finding out later and having it somehow ruin my life. I've worried about people with past grudges coming out of the woodwork and destroying my life the moment I let myself be happy, so I typically don't let myself enjoy things, be loved by others, or spend much time attaining my goals because I'm convinced I'll lose everything one day due to some fault or slight from my past.

Right now this anxiety is latching onto online friends I've had over the years. I've been involved in fandom on tumblr, not so much anymore but definitely heavily between ages 18-21. I've stepped away from it lately because I have my own projects to work on, but when I was active in tumblr fandom, I made a lot of friends in these spaces due to shared interests. I'm friends with many of these people to this day, which SHOULD be a good thing, but lately I've been obsessing over how affectionate our friend spheres were with each other. Not in sexual ways of course, just friendly affection like complimenting each other's selfies, our pieces of writing, just general stuff.

I'm terrified right now that my life is ruined because some of these friends were younger than me and I'd do the friendly gushing to them as well. One of my closest friends was 17 at the time and I was 20, and we'd reblog each other's selfies saying how pretty we looked, how pretty all of our friends were, etc. None of these comments were ever flirty or sexual in nature, just the way that girls compliment each other to lift each other up to feel more confident. But I feel like I'm an evil horrible person because I feel like I should have known better than to tell my 17-year-old friend that she was beautiful because someone else could potentially read that as flirting which would make me look like a predator and my life would be over. I always meant the compliments from a place of friendship, not a place of attraction, but then I get intrusives telling me that I AM a creep, that everyone around me DID think I was disgusting (even though we were all friends with each other?) and I can't get past it.

I'm a writer whose career has just started taking real steps forward, and I'm terrified that at any moment some part of my past that I thought was inconsequential and innocent will come up and bite me in the ass. I've always tried to be a good person, and my OCD makes me hyper-aware of ever fucking up and doing something bad, so I've always been extra careful not to make mistakes in my life. But does this count as a mistake? Complimenting my friends' selfies equally, even though some were younger than me? I never said the compliments from a place of attraction to any of my friends, but always just a place of fondness and friendship and support. But what if someone else wouldn't think that and would assume I meant the compliments sexually because I was older? How would I defend myself and tell them I always only meant compliments as a close friend?

I can't function today. This obsession sprang up out of nowhere after years of not thinking twice about my old online friendships. I keep getting these intense cold sweats and shakes and fits of sobbing, all over this stupid issue that no one else would ever dissect to this degree. I'm still friends with the one who my anxiety is latching onto, who's 21 now, and she recently got back in touch with me and told me I've been a positive influence in her life, that my friendship encouraged her to come out to her parents recently even though we hadn't talked in a long time, so I'm not sure what the issue with my brain is right now. Shoudn't I be happy that I was a positive person in this girl's life? Like, shouldn't that alone be enough to tell me that I WASN'T ever coming off as creepy to her and that everything was fine?

I was assaulted by a man in his 20s when I was 17, and I'm wondering if maybe this obsession is just misplaced guilt from that assault? I'm absolutely obsessed with thoughts of being a horrible person like the man who assaulted me; it's like my brain is looking for proof as to why I'm just as evil and perverted as he is, and the only evidence it's able to dig up is how I had a friend who was 17 who I used to compliment and tell her she looked pretty. It's asinine but it won't stop. I had to have a skype call with my girlfriend because I was so hysterical over this, and she told me that everything is fine, that I'm not a creep, even read the tags I left on my friend's selfies and said they didn't seem weird or overstepping at all. Yet still I'm so scared.

Can someone please help me, especially if you've struggled with moral scrupulosity and obsessions of accidentally being a creep? The panic got so intense today I felt like I couldn't go on anymore, as if I had committed a crime of such enormity that I had to die to repent for it. I'm not going to hurt myself, but the thoughts are extremely distressing and I can't talk myself down from this on my own."

0,"Anxiety: what helps and when to consult a psychiatrist? I've had long and short bouts of anxiety throughout my life -- the type where you feel you are going to die, all day. I'm only really recognizing that in the last few years. *My question is if going to a psychiatrist has helped you and what kind of medication(s)?*

**Here is how I've managed so far over the past 10+ years:** I've had 2 good therapists, one I'm still with. I do not drink, although had a relapse, now sober again 6 months. I do meditation (but that doesn't help when I'm in it, or right before it, in fact it makes it worse), I walk every day and eat normally. No coffee and very little sugar. Talking to people and being with dogs also help.

**As far as medication**: when I can get RX valium periodically it helps. I cut 5mg in half and wait for heart rate to come down. In a few hours I might take the other half if needed. But if the heart rate comes down I don't take more later. I've tried SSRIs but they increase my anxiety.

**Next:** I've heard of klonopin, buspar and beta blockers, but have not tried them. Is this what a psychiatrist is for -- to sort out what would work? Do they listen? I can see taking something as needed, not everyday as I can be fine for periods of time. But when it hits it's disabling.

0,"Can you identify this feeling? I sometimes have this strange feeling that I cant seem to place.
Its like the room expands and turns black. Whether Im alone or in with people doesnt seem to matter. At that moment Im alone in a large dark room. 
The question here is, does anybody know what this might be?
(Yeahyeah I know professional hell blabla) "
0,"I’m not sure why this happens. My sister plays video games a lot, and when she does, she always invites one of her friends into a phone call to chat together while playing. 

However, hearing her laugh and talk with her friends gives me such bad anxiety. I can’t do much else besides whimper and  cry and scream. 

And every time I ask her to quiet down, she just gets louder, which makes me more anxious, which results in more screams. It eventually becomes so bad that she ends the phone call with her friend and hides out in her room. It makes me feel guilty every time. 

I’m not sure why this happens. It doesn’t happen (that bad) when anyone else in my family takes a phone call. It’s just with my sister that it gets that bad. "
0,"Difficulties thinking of what to write/speak It often feels like my mind is going a million miles a minute. It makes it harder to think of the appropriate things to say or write to coworkers and friends.

Does this happen to anyone else?

For example, I work in a job with daily deadlines, and by the time my work is ready to look over, I’m a bit frazzled. My bosses offer me corrections and I can’t think of anything to say except one word answers, and usually finish with an awkward expression of gratitude. This is compared to others there who seem to be able to say or type something witty and considerate. They are cordial and sociable with each other. It feels lonely, like a prison I can’t escape from bc my communication is wrong or weird.

Afterward, I have a harder time taking to people in general. A friend texted me today and my responses were sort of trite and skewed toward the negative, just “off.” It feels like my anxiety makes me act strange, and it annoys people. How are other people so eloquent?

*I feel like anxiety makes me hyper focused on my own internal feelings, so there is less focus on what’s actually in front of me, how others think or feel in a situation.* I’ve known this for awhile and try to focus on others, and fail over again.

It’s frustrating bc I had sort of a outside focus and wit years ago, as well as a better understanding of social norms and behaviors. I felt friendlier, more considerate, more confident.

Maybe I will go for a work out and try to clear my head. Maybe it’s just a matter of keep trying, keep focusing on improvement despite these faults.

0,"Should I continue taking Escitalopram? Hey guys. I started taking Cipralex (escitalopram) on Monday for anxiety and some depression. Before taking it, I was spiralling into panic attacks almost every morning, and was a real mess. 

I know with the meds come side effects. I'm only on day 3, and my palms are really sweaty and warm. Like, my trackpad on my laptop sometimes doesn't work because it's wet from sweat. Other than that, I've been getting some minor stomach problems, and my anxiety has been through the roof. I can maybe deal with the other side effects, but this anxiety is really killing me. How do I even know if it's anxiety from the medication, or my own anxiety I was having before? I'm only on 5mg, which is practically the lowest dose, and I'm supposed to go to 10mg on Saturday, but the thought of increasing my anxiety even more really scares me. I feel like I have no way out here. If I stay on this medication, I can't function. If I stop taking it, I still have an anxiety disorder, and can't function. I've been staying at my mom's place these past few days, because I usually live alone, and dealing with this on my own is really scary. My mom has been off work for 2 weeks, but today is the first day she's back to work, and being alone has really fucked me up. 

I just miss who I was before this anxiety. I know this medication might make my anxiety better, but then I'd eventually have to come off the medication, and the withdrawal symptoms would make my anxiety come back. I feel like I'm just postponing my anxiety disorder. I feel really hopeless. Im off work until Friday, and I find when I have nothing to do, I just stay at home, stay in bed, watch movies to try and get my mind off of everything, but I find everything I watch recently is causing me anxiety for some reason. I got really anxious today and even googles psych wards near me. I really feel like I'm losing it. "
0,"My brother has a friend over for the week I hope this is the right place to post this, sorry if it's not.

My brother is in college(I'm only in high school), which means he can't live in the dorms over winter break. My parents said his friend who's family is out of state can live here over break.

0,Walking slow to avoid people that I don’t even know! I’ve just noticed that my entire life I would walk slow because I didn’t want to pass people (usually groups ) on the way to school or work. I would get out my phone and just look at my home screen and risk being late. 
0,"Struggling w Nausea and Anxiety, wondering if anyone has had luck w natural remedies? I’ve had a lot of stomach issues since high school, a lot of which is directly related to my stress levels which I’ve now realized is connected to my anxiety.

0,"Unable to live in the moment - have a need to plan out my life My bf and I recently broke up and I'm still coming to terms with it. This post isn't about the break up itself, it's just one of the things I came to realize during this reflection/mourning period. 

After moving back home from university (and perhaps I did it even then), I have this incessant *need* to plan out the next two weeks of my life. I get a rush of anxiety about needing to fill out my time, making sure I'm seeing my boyfriend/friends at least x times a week, etc. It's gotten worse now that I'm no longer together with him, but it was always present. At the beginning of the week I'd always ask: ""So what are we doing this week?"" or ""When are we meeting?"". Yes, I was excited to see him, but I was also perhaps scared of not filling up my time?

It's weird because the days I don't see anyone are fine, I'm fairly introverted and like spending time alone as long as I'm certain about the next time I see someone (whether that's my ex or a friend). 

Has anyone experienced this? It's quite exhausting and unhealthy and I can't break it and live in the moment.

One thing to add is that my core group of girlfriends, my best friend, and a few other close friends no longer live near me (they're hours away) so although I do have a good number of friends in general, people I can reach out to and hang out with, I no longer have that solid foundation of close friends except for perhaps 1 or 2. And now I no longer have my boyfriend who was also my best friend. I'm just trying to learn to be okay."
0,"Strangers make fun of me I was in Amsterdam not too long ago because I had a very long transit time till my next flight, took the opportunity to go downton. 
 
The whole time I was walking around people would look at me and stifle a laugh and if they were behind me they’d talk about me. There was even one instance where an old man walked past me and said, out loud, “shit, your face is fucking ugly”. These people think speaking in a different language means I don’t undestand but little do they know that I can and it hurt. so much. 
It got so bad that I was only in town for 2 hours and had to literally rush back to the airport before I felt like I’d break down. 

I don’t know if it matters but I have gained significant weight over the year due to a really bad life event that had happened, and I don’t think I’m that ugly but even if I were it still doesn’t justify why they do what they did.
It really sucked cause I had already planned what I wanted to do in town and only managed to do two things before I had to leave. I’m now at home lying in bed crying over what had happened cause honestly this wasn’t the first time I’ve experienced it, in the same place too. It really is a shame, I always frequent to Amsterdam as a transit destination and have loved it in the past when I was ‘thinner’, received close to zero hate then. 

I know that I shouldn’t let it beat me down but it’s hard not to. Words can really hurt... in any languages.

0,"Anxiety over weight gain At the start of 2017, I reluctantly began trying to recover from bulimia. Over the course of the year, I went from 110 pounds to 150 due to purging less and trying to eat ""normally"", and I'm still not fully recovered. So now I'm just fat and bulimic (woohoo!) Every day I have severe anxiety over my weight gain, especially when I see myself in reflective surfaces in public/school. I try not to look at mirrors or windows, but sometimes I catch a glimpse of myself and it ruins my day. I guess the natural answer is to lose weight (which I'm trying to do) but in the meantime, everything sucks and I'm constantly anxious and pissed off over my body and having to be seen in public. Anyone else feel the same body anxiety? Therapy isn't helping at all. "
0,"Is this a panic attack? Hi! My doctor says that panic attacks come from nowhere and I concluded that what I have is not panic attacks. I wish we would've talked more. What I feel is similar to the symptoms: feeling of impending doom, loss of control, sometimes tingling and numbness in hands, feeling like I can't breathe. The issues is that these symptoms happen for a specific reason. Last time it happened because something my very new boyfriend did that upset me and I thought about the last breakup I had and how much of a toll it took on me and how I don't want to feel like that ever again. My last breakup was very very devastating to me. So to conclude, what I felt was in response to a thought about the breakup. Is it a panic attack if it doesn't come from nowhere? If not, then what is the name for it?"
0,"How do you deal with a break up with anxiety? I'm going through a break up and don't have a support system of friends around me due to extreme social anxiety.

0,"Experiences with anti-anxiety medication A good friend of mine has struggled with severe anxiety for her entire adult life.  It's getting worse, and I think it's leading to other problems such as severe paranoia/insecurity.  I care about her very much, and my concern is growing daily.  It's getting to the point that she can't even leave her house.

I have recommended seeing a doctor about trying anti-anxiety medication.  My friend has always hated the idea and refuses to give it a shot.

I'm wondering, did any of you change your mind at some point and give it a try?  Did it help?  Did you wish you had done it sooner?  Can anybody attest to the effectiveness of meds?

I realize everybody is different, mentally and physically, but I can't help but fantasize about a life where she can take a pill in the morning and be free from this horrible struggle.

If anybody has anything to offer on the subject, I'd greatly appreciate it.

Thanks"
0,"Cause of anxiety not at all related to the panic attack/anxiety triggers? Hi guys....
So my best friend mentioned to me today if I’d thought about the fact that my anxiety may be due to my boyfriend and I recently switching over to a long distance relationship.

I can see what she means because my anxiety HAS increased drastically the past 6 months, which is the timespan where my boyfriend has been living far away.
And although I’m thinking lots about him, there are nothing to worry about - we have an amazing relationship. But I still DO spend a lot of time thinking of him.

BUT, my anxiety attack triggers are not at ALL related to my boyfriend... My anxiety comes when I’m eating food and I’m afraid of getting nauseaus afterwards... and also I can’t stand feeling like I’m trapped... like in a train, bus, car, theatre etc...

But my question is: Can my anxiety have it’s roots in something, that isn’t at all related to my triggers?

Hope it makes sense.... Thanks"

0,"Does Sertraline affect your periods? I was wondering if anyone could provide me on their experiences with sertraline if they too have had it affect their periods.

I started taking it at the end of November/start of December time. A few days later I came on my period, it was nowhere near as heavy - just very spotty, and it remained spotty for about 2 1/2 to 3 weeks. I told my doctor and he made a note of it in the follow up review. 

I've become really bloated being on it, gone up from a size 10 to a 12, and I've not come on still. My paranoia is kicking in saying I'm pregnant but I know that pretty much isn't possible, so I put it down to the sertraline side effects. I just wanted to know if it messes with anyone else's cycle too. 

(I have the coil and my boyfriend always pulls out in time, so the chances of my getting pregnant are, hopefully, very slim! But the coil has caused my periods to be weaker and a bit all over the place)"
0,"I'm sick of it. What do you do when the one person that causes 90% of your anxiety and uneasiness...is your dad?  

I think I can say with confidence that he is the one person in this world that I truly hate. He is loud, hot headed, short tempered, self-absorbed, childish, stubborn, and inconsiderate.  

My mom is the sweetest, most hard working person I know, and there have been many mornings when I wake up to him yelling, screaming, cursing at her for the smallest thing, even if it is his own fault. My mom is not only a full time doctor, she is a full time housewife, since my dad does not help around the house at all. She has to cook for everyone, clean after everyone, and take care of my little sister, all the while having to quietly bear his verbal abuse. 


Just this morning, my dad was saying he was overwhelmed planning this stupid summer trip. My mom asked how she could help, and said that we don't have to do every single thing that TripAdvisor says to do (my dad follows that religiously). He started screaming at her saying that she is always ""coming after him."" It makes my blood boil because she is the last person on Earth who deserves this treatment.

Their marriage was an arranged marriage, and they are a complete mismatch. My parents are pretty traditional Indians, so divorce is out of the question. My dad expects her to always ask about his day or make him coffee, but refuses to reciprocate it when she needs it. My mom always calls to check up on his parents when they are sick, but when her dad falls and gets a fracture he doesn't give a shit. My mom undoubtedly gets overwhelmed, but you don't see her screaming and yelling.

I'm just glad I'm home from college so that she can have someone to confide in and cry to, and it tears my heart apart. Because of all this yelling, my anxiety flares up whenever I'm in the same room with my dad, and I hate spending time with him. 

My mom, my sister, and I are much happier when he's away.

My heart is pounding and I am shaking just writing this. It ended up being a lot longer than I wanted, sorry. He is toxic to my mom and i, and yet we cannot remove him from our life. I was wondering if you guys have gone through something similar, or if you have any advice. Thank you.

TL;DR Dad causes my anxiety because of the way he treats my mom and verbally abuses her.

0,"Speaking the truth I have suffered with anxiety now for a good few years. Over the past year my anxiety has decreased drastically and I haven’t been experiencing it much, or had any panic attacks in about 5 months. The past few days it has been increasing again, purely because of workload stress and studying pressure. One of the main things I have noticed with anxiety is no one understands it, and if it is not understood point blank - no one gives a fuck. 

My whole life I have kept it a secret about myself. When a few years ago I finally plucked up some courage and spoke to a boyfriend at the time about it. His advice, and everyone else’s advice is to “speak to someone, open up”. Now something people without anxiety don’t understand is how scary it is to open up to people. We are told all our lives that to be down is to be “weak”, and to not get up and carry on is to “fail”. So to openly admit your struggling is the biggest challenge of them all.

After months of debating I finally opened up. I got help. And I felt better. Now it’s creeping back again, and I am no longer with my ex. I decided to open up to some friends to help me. They all say “always here” “will help you with everything” but reality is when you need them most they ignore your calls and messages and never even ask if your ok. My ex told me to not speak to him about it. And my parents had a go at me because I am seen as some sort of “freak”.

So I come across like I have this amazing life with great friends and family. When reality is none of them actually give a fuck and I’ve never felt so alone. All I want is for someone to ask if I’m ok, and be there. But no one, not one person, cares even.  I don’t know how to deal with knowing I’m alone in this..."
0,"Welcome back anxiety Do you also have this disturbing feeling in your gut when you are coming back from a holiday break? I didn't go to work yesterday because coming back gives me chills. I was away for only a week, but it feels like it was a month. I have extreme anxiety about work related problems. On top of that, I absolutely hate these generic fake smile conversations about ""how was your holidays?"". I would not come back for another week, just to avoid this phase of everybody's new year excitement. "
0,"Sorry for the long post but need help Hi all, 

I’m new to this group. I guess I’ll get right into it. I’ve always been a quiet and shy person. I felt as though I have been suffering from some sort of anxiety in the past but I’ve always either been able to deal with it or suppress it. However, it feels as though things are getting worse and my anxiety is getting more severe. I find myself having to excuse my self or sneak away to try and calm myself down in private a few times a day. I am having trouble focusing, and I’m not sleeping well. I wake up in the middle of the night with a pounding heart and a sinking feeling in my stomach. Everything seems fine on the outside and I don’t think anyone would know I have any type of anxiety but on the inside I am constantly nervous, scared, and worried. I find myself avoiding certain situations and areas through out my day. 

There are some times through out the day that I am totally fine and it’s great. However, more often then not I find myself worrying. Mornings are by far the worst for me. I’ve been reading that getting into a morning routine sometimes can help take your focus off your anxiety. I have a very steady routine every morning but it just doesn’t seem to help one bit. 

I’m embarrassed to tell my parents and I’m worried about my job. I’m in the coast guard and it’s known as the “life saving” service. I’m worried that my anxiety will put my crew at risk or someone who needs help at risk. What if I have an attack when something serious is going on? Or I’m out on the boat? 

I really don’t know what I should do about it. I’m worried about discharge, however the ironic part is I think it’s my job that is intensifying my anxiety. It feels as though all of this is building up and im worries it’s going to build up into bone big attack where I may lose it. 

As far as treatment - would seeing/talking to someone help? Medication? What impacts could medication have on my daily life or with my job? "
0,"How do i do this I can't take any of  this anymore.  I've shut my self from almost everyone, and tried to talk about my problems to my friend. I've  been more or less successful in trying to open up to her, but am still not sure my self in many ways so not fully.

I don't know how to fucking get to know people and talk to people in general so i feel like she's disinterested in me, since all I do is request support and don't know how to help her, or just never know what to talk about. Really want to know her better and be someone better in her life, so that maybe shed view me as support rather than a burden. She tells me it's not true but I'm sure I'm not as indipentent as I need to be. Even if I want to help her and love her too much not to.

I just don't know how to get there, or even start. We hung out a lot more months ago and I've fucking always been my quiet self and talk to her the best alone, but rarely were, and never are now. I try to tell her but I don't know what she can do about my problem, and probably has had enough of me. I've just been playing this anxiety, contusion driven game where I touch the outter layers of a problem and don't really get to the core. The big one is probably obvious by now, I want her to like me back, more at the least, by getting to know her better and being a positive support for her like she has me.

How the fuck do I do that though??? My mind always goes blank and floods with my problems and I just want to feel less selfish to her. Before we hung out a few time a week at most but now we'll text once twice a week. And my social anxiety doesn't like texting, and making plans. But I also can't say what I want to say because it becomes too long, feel need to retype etc. I think the best way to start talking more again is to get her interested in texting me.

How do I do that? What do I ask? How do I stop my self from dead ending the text and then say she's done texting me for the day. How do I coherently get my thoughts out without overthinking and making more questons/get too depressed to think clearly. I've been thinking of getting and taking some phenibut or looking at other things at /r/nootropics so I could just stop this shit I do but don't even understand. It feels too easy though, and she has anxiety too so it feels like a copout to me. I just want to stop this, talk to her, hangout happy, talk about interests etc without sitting there in silence struggling to get out a sentence that's got enough substance to keep us going/me from going blank. I'll probably try through text since I i know to ask is how are you and ask about things she says but then that's kinda it"
0,"Help :( I'm a 22 year old male Uni student. Was diagnosed with depression and anxiety over 5 years ago, and the symptoms had gradually improved over time. However, a year ago, I began to have difficulty sleeping, paticulary getting to sleep and also waking up every 1-2 hours, sometimes not being able to get back to sleep afterwards. I have felt fatigued, generally so tired and weak for the last 12 months. 

This year I have tried Flouxetine, Citalopram, Amitriptyline and Mitrazapine which haven't really benefited me. All have reduced my sex drive which is awful because I'm in a relationship with a lovely girl and I want it to thrive. I have packed in the drugs, stopped drinking every weekend, stopped smoking and even quit caffeine. I have taken up running also and would consider myself fit and well (10km in sub 45 minutes) 

After 2 weeks (around Mid December) on Mitrazapine, I have had constipation, dizziness, tinnitus and a burning stomach, in addition to my other symptoms, I have been off Mitrazapine for over a week now and things don't seem to be improving, also I have noticed that things have worsened since coming off caffeine?!? I have been off caffeine for over 3 weeks and I feel more anxious than ever! 

Whatever is going on with me is making me feel so suicidal, I sit in bed all day, knackered, googling my symptoms, watching my Uni life, girlfriend, family and job suffer, I can't take it much longer and I seriously don't see a way out. I have been to the hospital twice, bloodtests are fine apart from high bilirubin, and my stomach scan also showed as fine, awaiting a colonscopy for my cramps but I'm guessing that will come back as fine as well.

It’s hard, I used to think I was alone against this horrid monster, it felt like I could only see it, deal with it. I opened up to my family and they have helped me so much I couldn’t be more grateful.

Over the past few months I felt great, wasn’t overthinking, not an intrusive thought in sight I was happy. Coming into the new year I went to see star wars with my brothers. It’s been awhile since I left my area of living and felt the anxiety building, something I almost forgot about,rearing it’s ugly little head. When I got home that night I cried so much, I thought I beat it but I’ve come to realise that I might have this the rest of my life but I will have good times and bad times and I will never let it win. I’m not going back to being scared of my mind I’m moving forward and I will continue working on improving my life and remember when it gets bad that it won’t last forever.

Thank you for listening.

0,"Feeling pretty sick but am nervous to leave work early. What do you constitute as bad enough to miss work? Last night I started feeling very sick (flu sick, slight fever, chills, chest congestion). I was also exhausted but didn’t fall asleep until late. When I woke up this morning, I was very tired and felt better but still didn’t fell well, but when I took my temperature it was fine so I went to work. I’ve been here three hours and I feel dead and all I want is my bed. 

I have ample sick time to use, but it’s the third day of the year and don’t want to have to use it so soon. I also get really bad anxiety leaving work early (and calling in) because I’m afraid my boss isn’t going to think I’m sick and then I wonder if I’m just overreacting and I should tough it out. 

Does anyone else stress about this? What are your limits of sickness to miss work?"
0,"[Minor TW: Nuclear Weapons and Whatnot] To people With nuclear war anxieties: A Couple of Ways to Ground Yourself and Stop Worrying (from a fellow panicker) **DISCLAIMER:** For geopolitical purposes and familiarity, I am writing this from the perspective of a citizen of the United States through their conflict with North Korea. My mind in organizing this long post will result in some presumably all-over-the-place points (some political and some with language if you're not into that), but hopefully my personal grounding methods and thoughts will benefit and calm you guys. Also, incredibly long post ahead!

Hey friends! For a brief introduction about myself and the topic, I'm /u/Smaaaaaash, and I've been posting a lot about worrying with nuclear war, whether it be with North Korea, Russia, or literally anyone the POTUS is pissing on about on twitter. This is because I took a class about the Cold War during the political climate of the 2016 election, which was probably one of the dumbest decisions I could have made for the time, especially with my long-term struggles with anxiety and (I suppose) hypochondria. Regardless, despite my suffering, I have resolved to stop my endless panic over the idea of nuclear war so I can live without the constant worry that a cold war would bring (note: I do not believe we are currently living in a cold war. More on that later.) To help my fellow friends who are struggling with the freaky thoughts of nuclear war, here is a list of stuff that I am doing to separate myself that may just help you:

**1. DISMANTLE IRRATIONAL THOUGHTS**

Despite what the news, twitter, reddit, and anyone may say, the possibility of a nuclear war is statistically extremely low. Every global leader that has power over nukes has not used them in their reign of power (and they have not been used as literal weapons since 1945), and they each understand that nuclear war would be a big L for their side. (Yes, even Kim and Trump.) If that's the case, why does Trump keep talking about it? Besides off-hand comments and comparisons to Brigadier General Ripper from Doctor Strangelove that I could make, it's his weird-ass form of diplomacy. For example, the tweet he made earlier today concerning Kim's statement that the launch button was in his office was a way to say that if they attack us, they'll be blown the hell out as well. This is a way to stop Kim from attacking us. (Also, let me talk about that statement for a second: this headline actually led to [this article](http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/31/asia/kim-jong-un-new-year-address-nuclear/index.html), which states that Kim Jong-Un is willing to send a representative to Seoul's Olympics next month. He only used the threat of a launch button in the way that a dad makes sure that his daughter's prom date behaves: a threat that probably won't happen but gets a message across. I personally think CNN dropped the ball when they tried to make said comment the headline, since that triggered a Trump tweet, but I doubt anything will come of it.) Anyways, nobody wants a nuclear war because it will end with them and their shit getting destroyed, bluntly put. Plus, we all have rational thinkers on each side: Trump, regardless of his tweeting antics, is reigned back by General Mattis and Congress from declaring war or doing dumb stuff, and Kim Jong-Un has Russia and China, who don't seem to want anything starting, saying they'll drop support if NK chucks a nuke anywhere first. There's a lot going on, but a lot of it is diplomatic; the US Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, is open to diplomacy with NK, and analysts have pointed out that [NK seems to want to talk now](https://www.npr.org/2017/11/29/567313555/how-diplomatic-engagement-with-north-korea-could-proceed). I could go on and on about how war isn't happening, but for the sake of character limits I'll leave it to the idea that nuclear war is not actually on the table, despite the dick-waving that global leaders tend to do. It's mostly just to say 'fuck you don't nuke us', and dropping a bomb gives more loss than gain, which nobody wants, not even Trump or Kim. 

So what do you do with this information? Every time your mind wanders to the idea of anything related to this, shut it down. Ground yourself. Rationalize. Take a minute to breathe, find what makes you sure your fear is just a passing thought, and use it to cross-examine your fear and call it out. (If you need help figuring this out, check out older threads on /r/anxiety about nuclear fears or PM me. I'll do my best!) I personally keep a note on my phone dedicated to debunking my own arguments, be they about Trump, Korea, Russia, or survival, and it works pretty well when I'm not getting influenced by things like sensationalist news. ""But /u/Smaaaaaash,"" you ask, ""what do I do about sensationalist news and the like?"" Well...

**2. DISTRACT FROM TRIGGERS**

Remember when I said that CNN made the headline of their article about Kim Jong-Un wanting to work with South Korea a headline that focused on North Korea's nuclear capability? They primarily did that to get responses. That gets them clicks, attention, money, anything that a news network needs to survive. Although it's good to spread awareness about worrisome stuff like nuclear work or climate change through the news, a lot of headlines and articles are sadly sensationalized for the moola. This is why you may want to consider taking a break from news sources that talk big up front but provide little information. Trust me, if something big is happening, you'll know it. From my point of view, most of my irrational anxiety/panic surrounding a nuclear breakout comes from the news or reddit posts, which I find validates my insecurities about war occurring. It's a matter of finding a way to either not look at these posts at all or debunking their bs. When it comes to debunking sensationalism and fear, rationalize anything you might come across with the knowledge of how leaders behave (a la part 1) and the knowledge of the past. For instance: remember when NK said the acts of the US in September were a 'declaration of war'? Even the comment section on /r/worldnews, which usually also freaks out and hypes up fights, [called out their strats up-front](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/72czz5/n_korea_accuses_us_of_declaring_war/). Also, this may not seem relevant now, but [this AskReddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6xs941/redditors_old_enough_to_remember_the_cold_war_how/) says a lot about the state of today in comparison to when the world could blow itself up like 300 times over. It's sobering, especially when you consider that we've gone through events like the Cuban Missile Crisis without blowing ourselves up. We may currently have a Cheeto Benito in office, but despite his bravado-based diplomacy, I believe there are other things that we as citizens can focus on when it comes to the quality of the USA.

As for distracting yourself from these situations altogether, besides steering clear of the stuff I mentioned earlier, try picking up a new hobby or watching some TV. Something productive or calming, like starting a garden or cleaning your room/house/local area, is usually pretty relaxing, especially with music. Personally, I'm grabbing a blu-ray box set of the Star Wars movies so I can figure out how The Last Jedi stands up to them, but use something to help take your focus from toxic sites that can draw you in really easily. If you really need a news kick, I'd recommend stuff that draws a smile or a laugh, like /r/UpliftingNews or /r/nottheonion. I understand it's not healthy to distract yourself from a problem, so if you believe that, then focus on understanding any situation and preparing for whatever you feel fit. That being said, I believe that there is not much of an urgent problem right now and we can divert our attention towards things we can control. (Also, if you're worried about control, then there is a good form of control in our world, despite all the crazy shit that happens/that you think would happen.)

**3. COMMUNICATE**

I could not be as far as I am in overcoming my phobia without talking to my amazing girlfriend and her kickass mom. In fact, her mom also struggled with anxiety through her youth/young adulthood, which happened to be during the Cuban Missile Crisis and Reagan years (read: hot spots of the Cold War). She thinks nothing will come of ""Trump/Kim's pissing contest"", and as much as my better-safe-than-sorry side wants to say otherwise, I'm inclined to agree. Even if you're shy or have trouble with socializing (I still don't fuckin know how I got into a relationship), there are plenty of ways to talk and defuse personal tensions, whether it be online or with someone like a counselor or pastor. And if you need someone to talk to about your troubles, then you can always PM me or post on the sub :)

**OTHER STUFF THAT MAY HELP**

* Check out the essay ""On Living in an Atomic Age"" by the iconic C.S. Lewis. The first three paragraphs can be found [here](http://abamablog.blogspot.com/2006/10/cs-lewis-on-living-in-atomic-age.html), and the rest is probably found with the help of some Google-fu.

* If you're really worried about a nuclear war breaking out and stone-cold convinced it will, then the best thing I can suggest is prepare. Check out NBC masks and suits, pick up a copy/pdf of *Nuclear War Survival Skills*, and work from there. I respect your preparedness, and if anything happens, I'll buy you a beer. (Hopefully US tender will still work.)

***TL;DR: Nuclear war probably will not occur, based on previous events and the rationale of world leaders. (It is arguably also survivable, but that has far too many factors for me to cover.) Dismantle your irrational thoughts, distract yourself from any sensationalist news/posts/sites that talk about them, and communicate with friends, family, someone you trust, or a rational Internet community. You'll be alright.***

If you've made it this far, congratulations and thank you! Please feel free to leave tips that help you feel better in the comments, and I'll add them to the post! Also, please focus on posting positively; I know it's easy to fall into a cesspool of negativity with a topic like this, but it helps to not panic in a thread where others can see."

0,"bf has anxiety and is experiencing a tough time, looking for advice to best offer support. Possible anxiety-inducing post (financial) This is x-posted with r/advice.

Backstory: My boyfriend and I are currently long distance due to the job market in the area. Once I find work we will be reunited.

He just called in a panic, he is stressed beyond his limits with a lot of things but right now the financial part is at the forefront. He is behind in his office space rent and received a message from his landlord asking to meet. 

He has been unable to pay rent due in part to bad choices he's made plus some unfortunate circumstances. He knows this. He lives at home with his parents so his office has been a source of freedom to get his work done in a focused place. He has one other person who sub-rents from him, if he's evicted they will be too.

He has deep anxiety and has sought treatment for it with minimal success. We had a good talk last night about him reaching out when he needs extra support (I also promised to check in on a deeper level when I pick up on signs and just in general). He reached out this morning with the above information. I'm not in a position to help financially (he wouldn't take it even if I was) but I'm there for him emotionally. 

Usually I'm good at offering support and providing him with the extra advice or information he needs. I'm currently at a loss. I want to help his emotional state as best as I can but I'm not sure how to do that aside from telling him it will be okay. Which is a bit overplayed. How do I show support in this case, and is there anything I can say to him to help ease his mind?

Let me emphasize, looking for advice to help ease his anxiety not how to deal with the financial aspect.

Thank you for any help you can offer.

tl;dr Bf with anxiety, may be evicted from office space due to rent owed. Gf wants to offer emotional support to ease his mind.

0,"My Wife's Anxiety - Suggestions? Hey guys,

First time posting here and I'm not too familiar with anxiety (in all honesty I'm probably too relaxed about everything).  Unfortunately my wife (and somehow all of her siblings) deal with what seems to be pretty heavy anxiety.  My wife is concerned and stressed about almost everything.

Unfortunately about a month ago she was in a car accident (the other driver rear-ended her while texting) and now she's has a ton of anxiety about just driving to work.  We have a morning light for her to get some Vitamin-D (I believe?) that she uses but that's not really helping much.

Is there any over the counter anti-anxiety medication that anybody would recommend that she could take before going to work that also doesn't make you drowsy?  Any suggestions would be appreciated!  I'm just trying to help my wife feel less stressed in general."
0,Anxiety changed into cyclical mini panic Anyone else have anxiety like this? I’ve had anxiety for a couple years now and it was pretty well treated with Zoloft. Seemingly out of no where I started having mini panic attack’s where I get an intense feeling of dread and fear. Luckily it is usually short lived but happens many many times throughout the day. I think it has something to do with my Norepinephrine levels being too high but can’t confirm and am basing this on purely anecdotal evidence. Anyone have any insights/suggestions??
0,"Can't seem to get better no matter what I try November and December were some of the worst months of my life. I burnt out at university, which resulted in me pretty much going insane for a week. I couldn't sleep more than 2 hours at a time, starved myself, had panic attacks that lasted 5-6 hours, and couldn't leave my house. With my parents help I was able to survive this and get my ass to the doctor's. I do not have a GP, so went to a walk-in clinic where I was prescribed citalopram. I then struggled through the rest of my semester and managed to finished. I've been on holiday for almost 2 weeks now, and despite the rest do not feel much better.


I am taking the meds (20 mg for a little over a month now), sleeping (7-8+ hours a night) and eating well, practicing yoga daily, and seeing a therapist for CBT. I am not having panic attacks anymore, but am instead struggling with leaving my house and feelings of depression. When I stay home to relax as I know I need, I feel sluggish, lazy and depressed. When I do go out, I feel extremely anxious and take no pleasure from it.


Because the medication was prescribed at a walk-in, I am not regularly monitored for dosage and have no idea if the meds are working as they should. My time with the therapist is covered by my dad's work insurance, and is only short-term which means I have ~2 sessions left before I'm forced to find someone else, and probably pay out of pocket which I can't afford. I will be starting my final semester of uni and returning to work in a week. I am dreading it. I actually have to go in to work for the afternoon today and am paralyzed despite it being an easy half day. Graduating uni is terrifying me (applied to grad school, second guessing whether that's a good idea, terrified of not finding a job if I choose not to go through with grad school).


I don't feel like I'm getting better, I feel like something in me is broken and can't be healed. I'm living with my parents, mustering up the strength to get through 1 day at a time, and completely crumbling at the end of each day because it has taken so much out of me.  I don't know what more to do."
0,"Flight anxiety Good morning. So, I am not a fan of flying in general...I also suffer from I would say moderate to severe anxiety. Tomorrow I am scheduled to fly on a Beechcraft King Air 250 Turboprop Jet that my company owns. It's only an hour flight, but I am nervous, much smaller than anything I've ever flown in. I just started this job 2 months ago and I fear having an anxiety attack 32,000 feet above the ground in the midst of my new coworkers. I have created a calming spotify playlist that I plan on listening to, I also plan on doing some yoga in the morning to try to get in the right mindset. Any other suggestions? Also...forecast for tomorrow super cold, sunny winds 15-25 mph with gusts up to 40 mph. "

0,"Everything is going to shit and I don’t know what to do So I’m just gonna day from the beginning that I usually wear boyish clothes that are baggy or loose I never wear tight clothes because they give me anxiety. I don’t know why but every time I wear them I just start crying or something that makes me look stupid but I can’t help it. Also I lie A LOT and I can’t help it either i lie so much it’s just tearing my life apart and damaging relationships. I always break down in my room at random times mostly when my mom is arguing and drinking. Now that that’s out of the way I got some new jeans to wear even though I barely wear them but I decided to wear them which was such a bad fucking idea. My legs are skinny and I’m always bullied for being so skinny and it really tore my self confidence down to the point where I haven’t worn anything tight in months. So I thought I actually looked good for a second then I saw my skinny toothpick legs which really got me sad. I am sorry if I sound stupid for complaining about being skinny but at my school everyone has to look “thicc” or just plain fat. You rarely see anyone skinny that’s not an exaggeration. Immediately when I was going to school I felt sad and mad at myself for wearing them I felt like shit. When i got into school I felt on the verge of tears and held it in even though I couldn’t talk without my voice breaking, all my friends noticed and it was very awkward. No one talked to me because they knew something was up. When I got into first period I sat down and it was worse but I still held back my tears. I knew I couldn’t make it through the day so I begged my mom to pick me up like a little baby because I felt very sick. And she wanted me to go to the nurse so the teachers didn’t know I was texting but I just kept saying the teachers wouldn’t let me because I didn’t have my agenda book (teachers have to sign it before you leave class) and by the time I saw her she was a mess because she was worried and very mad at the teacher which I immediately felt guilty. I have to act sick now so my mom doesn’t get mad but the guidance counselor actually talked to the teacher and told my mom I was lying WHICH IS REALLY FUCKING EMBARRASSING AND I HAVE TO SEE THAT TEACHER AGAIN. When I see her I will apologize and try to do as much as I can. I was just to shy to get up, I would of burst into tears. Please everything is just a mess I constantly feel like shit hating everything and can’t even dress like a normal human without crying (I’m a girl in case you didn’t know) and now everything is turning to more shit because I got caught in a serious lie that could of caused a teacher to be fired and I’m lying to my mom. Please advice?"
0,"Feeling Sick About Going Back to School I go back to college on Friday and school starts on Monday. I've been scared all break since my last quarter went really, really poorly. I'm a good student, but I've been struggling to get decent grades since I started university and this quarter is going to be my hardest one yet. I don't want to drop classes or reduce my workload because I won't be on track to graduate if I do. I'm so scared just thinking about the amount of work I have to do, I feel like I'm going to throw up. I haven't been able to relax at all for the last few weeks; I can't sleep and my stomach feels like a stone. And I know feeling anxious about this doesn't help, I end up being less productive because I'm so anxious I can't think straight.

0,"Has anybody broken up with a therapist? (Advice) Basically I’m paying way to much for this therapist because she had a group as well as individual and I wanted to connect with others but I’ve been through her complete group program now and need to find something in-network. 

Except I’m horrible at confrontation so I sent her an email. Granted it was New Years yesterday but I assume she’s back today. No response. 

In the past I’ve felt this therapist has tried to kind of manipulate me into paying for more than I need.

I kept my appointment for tomorrow as a last appointment because I figured it’s better to say something in person than just drop off but she hasn’t responded to the email and my gut feeling is she’s going to try and manipulate / convince me into not stopping and honestly I’m pretty susceptible. 

Right now I just feel anxious and awful and I want to just avoid the appointment entirely and tell her I’m sick (and yes she could then charge me full price for not cancelling in time if she’s annoyed but it almost seems worth it)

Any advice or similar experience? "
0,"After years and years of putting it off, I finally made an appointment with a counselor. I don't really have anyone to tell, and this is a major accomplishment for me. I almost feel like crying. I don't have a good reason why I didn't do this sooner, but I'm really happy that I finally did. "

I couldn't get rid of this ridiculous idea that everyone in line was watching me (as I was just wandering around cluelessy) and I finally went up to ask a question. Turned out my books weren't ready and she said it so loud I knew people heard and I just couldn't handle it. I went back to the car and drove to ship something, forgot to pay and felt more ashamed. Im kind of spiraling right now. I could really use some advice of how to go about starting school again. Its been 3 years since highschool. I just feel like im always being watched or judged.

0,"I want to make a short film but my I feel silly about bringing it up. I don't actually know if my particular issue deserves to be in this subreddit but here goes..

As the title says, I want to make a short horror film. I want every one working on it with me to be my friends. I have tonnes of artistic and talented friends in all departments who could help, and would help if I asked. But whenever I sense the perfect opportunity to ask, I bail. I feel silly about wanting to make a movie, especially when I have no experience or even any qualifications that remotely tie in with the film industry. It'll be my first ever project like this, and probably the biggest thing I'll take on in a long time. But, again, bringing the idea up is halted by an anxiety that really has no reason to be their yet it is anyway. 

Not sure what I'm hoping to get out of posting this, I guess I just wanted to speak my film making dream into existence but with the anonymity of Reddit so that my anxiety about telling my friends/family might go away soon. 

Anxiety has effected me for a very long time. My biggest triggers are public transport and being in crowded spaces but not knowing anyone who is there, and since neither of my triggers associate with my current issue it leaves me puzzled. If there's any methods or just something that can possibly help me get over it I'd be very grateful. "

0,"Trying to rest in my doctor's message rather than read into it. Trying to not do stupid things prior to my visit. I found what appears to be a lump or hard vein on my shoulder. At first I thought it was cool. I'd been working out (as a part of anxiety treatment), and like a dork, thought it must be a sign of fitness! Big muscles popping the veins out like on TV, RAWR!

Well, there went my moment. Then I decided it wasn't a vein, it's a tumor. Then I decided it's a vein again, with a clot. So I took some pics, put them on AskDocs, and got ""probably nothing, but could be something awful so get it checked out."" My doctor is a saint, and told me to message him on MyChart about this sort of stuff. I described it, sent a picture, and within a few hours (again, like a saint, as standard for this program is 2 business days) said ""it doesn't look urgent, if it gets much worse let me know.""

Awesome! I'm not having DVT of the arm! And then I went downhill. ""But there's a lot of bad options between healthy and urgent. Why didn't he say 'fine, nothing to worry about?'"" ""If it gets \*much\* worse? So is it already bad?"" ""Are we in a phase where it could be terrible, but we need to wait and see if it develops? After all, we don't always remove malignant tumors the same day as diagnosis.""

So I went from celebration to number of cognitive distortions telling me that what we are dealing with is something pretty bad that can wait a few days, with a potential beat the clock mechanism. 

And to think, I was in a fine state of recovery for over a year. Bummer. I already had an appointment with him for the 8th for a checkup, so I'll see him soon enough. Trying very hard not to fall into old checking habits."

0,"Urgent Help Needed, Ongoing panic attack waves all day Guys please I need immediate help, I've been having panic attacks all day. it's becoming unbearable. I can't call my doctor because she doesn't answer after a specific time and I just need some tips and tricks to keep me going until a few hours. My dad is been with me for 3 hours and it just won't stop, talking about it, trying to think about something else, watching series. Nothing is working, I'm not new to anxiety and panic attacks but for it to actually keep happening for more than 20 hours is new and it is becoming unbearable. 

Tell me anything that might help.

Should I take Valium or Xanax? 

Should I go to the ER ?"
0,"I can’t grasp my emotions Constantly I have been feeling two-sided with how I feel. When I experience something, I may feel a certain way, but my reaction would be totally different. There are many scenarios where I felt this. I have been told by a friend of mine that at times when I'm not preoccupied/distracted; when I'm waiting for the bus, eating, and such, I appear angry, though at times like that, I don't really have anything going through my mind. I decided to try to cease the angry image and relax, but instead, I shifted to a ""looked like I was about to cry"" image. Most of the time, I can't really describe my attitude, it's not that I don't feel anything, but there isn't a feeling to describe me. I simply exist.

When I was younger I abandoned my feelings. I was extremely self conscious so I tried to fit in and once I understood that I couldn't fit in, I tried to change. Despite my efforts, I was still seen as insignificant, I believed no matter what, I wasn't enough. Understanding that my efforts where hopeless, I gave up. I stopped trying to put effort, to care, to value life. I purposely separated myself from others, I tried to stop feeling.

I understand that this was a bit dramatic and this story sounds like fake self diagnosed depression, which it probably is, but the problem still stands, and I want to start putting effort into being more expressive with how I feel, instead of feeling like nothing. Of course I still have emotions but they are buried. How exactly can I regain the emotions that I've dug?

0,"Short term help, anxiety from drinking on NYE There are quite a few subs with anxiety in the name so I hope this is the right place to post this: 

So I gotta wait another week until I can see my therapist so asking reddit for short term help. 

On NYE I got black out drunk. I KNOW I did something wrong. Well at least one thing, probably 3. 

I'm having panic attacks because I don't know what happened. I could ask a good friend what happened, but I'm also scared about learning what happened. 

But I should ask so I can apologize for whatever happened before I owe it to the hosts and that makes anxiety worse. Woohoo, caught in a feedback loop. "
0,"Anxiety disagreeing with loved ones Hi there, I’ve come to realize that I get very strong anxiety every time telling the people closest to me how I feel. Not in the “I care about you” way. I have a hard time expressing my opinion, or my needs, if I know it differs from who I’m talking to.

And I’m sure anyone would feel anxious disagreeing with someone close to them— I’m so anxious about it that I either can’t say anything or I can get very long winded and lose my point. 

If you have any advice on how you deal with this if it happens to you, I’d love to hear! "
0,"What does it feel like to not be anxious, or at least the anxiety managed? I’ve been in therapy for about six months now and last week I started Zoloft. I have progressed a little bit but I also feel like my anxiety is a bit of the same or even worse because of what therapy has brought to light for me. My thoughts my whole life are constantly racing and not only I feel like I have anxiety about everything but it also seemingly arises for no reason. 

So I was just wondering what it’s like for people who  medication or therapy has helped them to reach a place of no or lesser anxiety. I know it might never go away but I’m just curious for what it’s like going from it being constant or it’s worse to managed and lesser. (Sorry if something similar has been answered before) "
0,First appoint - all paper work or maybe also treatment/medication In your experience on your first visit did your psychiatrist do or prescribe anything to at least attempt to treat your anxiety? I am asking because I have been struggling litterally for months and months to schedule my first appointment and I would hate to finally do it and the be too afraid to follow up and I have heard most first appointments are like meet and greets with paperwork which I understand needs to happen but I don't think would actually help at all in the short term.
0,"Owning a dog again is giving me extreme anxiety and stress Long story short, About 6 years ago I lost a dog to a tragic accident that was my fault. It haunts me still and I still feel incredibly guilty.

I had a lot of stress and anxiety after that event when it came to pets and life in general. But recently I got on anti-anxiety meds and things have been feeling better.

I was tired of feeling lonely and wanted a sense of companionship so I went to get a puppy. Well in the process of that I ended up fostering 4 puppies for a week because the shelter had no room for them. I really got connected with one of them and I was set to adopt him.

Then at the end of the week he went in to get neutered (required by the shelter before adoption) he passed away. They think it was due to a heart condition.

That tore open my old wounds hard and I swore off pets for life.

That was four months ago. Now, 5 days ago my fathers friends dog had puppies and wanted to give me one of them for free. After long contemplation and talking with my family I thought maybe it would help things.

I was wrong. For the past 5 days I have been so incredibly stressed and anxious about the puppy. He’s incredibly well behaved for a puppy and there’s no real reason I should be but anytime he’s not in my sight I just feel like I’m not being a good owner.

I worry I’m not giving him enough exercise or training him well and it feels like I have a huge weight on my chest and I can’t breathe. I know this is all probably just me subconsciously worrying something’s gonna happen again but I’m in agony. I barely sleep at night ironically worrying he’s gonna wake up and bark a bunch, waking up my family.

It’d be cruel to give him away and give up on him now. He learned his name. He’s potty trained. He sleeps in his kennel at night relatively hassle free. 

I don’t know what to do but I feel horrible all the time.

0,"CBD for anxiety? I’m not looking for recommendations so much as insights.

I’m already on medications (Lexapro and Buspirone) so already that’s one reason I should think twice about adding to the mix.

But I’m reframing my whole outlook and think that someday, if I can, I want to try to manage my anxiety without pharmaceuticals.

Anyway...

What does it feel like ? I’m considering oral solution as a starting point. 
Do you take some drops and feel calm within a few minutes? 

Do you feel tired or out of it?

How much do you take and how?

Do you also take meds?

In general, what is your experience and has it been positive?"
0,"How do you deal with Nocturnal Panic Attacks? I've had this issue that has popped up over the last several months where randomly while I am in bed sleeping I suddenly just feel this rush of panic hit me and blood starts pumping faster and my heart starts racing and I shoot out of bed. But often times my legs are weak since I take quetiapine to sleep. And then its just this back and forth where it feels like Im about to pass out, I roll around, drink water, stand up, emotions are all over the place and I want to call 911 but I wont because the last 3 times I went into the VA ER for ""heart palpitations"" or whatever I was experiencing I ended up having nothing wrong with me that I needed to be in the ER for. There is no consistency to the attacks, I've gone a week without it, then I'll have one, then I'll go a month, but I'm asking this question now because I've had really severe panic attacks at night 3 of the last 5 days, last night I was on the verge of puking it was so bad.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what can I do outside of drinking water or trying to take a deep breath? I've read on a couple sites I should just get up and go downstairs and fully wake up by doing something for 30-60 minutes until my heart rate has lowered. I just wanted some more personal opinions from people on this.

0,"Alright, hear me out. Does anyone get anxiety when it comes to people not texting you/snap chatting you as much? In my case though it’s with girls. Background info....I have a girl who Is basically a FWB and we snapped a lot but last time we actually had a conversation  was when I wished her happy birthday which was 7 days ago. Her response was fine and perfectly normal and I know she got busy because she literally went out every night that week of her birthday and she even sent me a snap saying Christmas week was such a long week. Then New Years came around which she went out again. I’m flying to see her on the 18th and the past month has been perfectly fine but just these past 7 days I guess I haven’t got the same attention that I’ve been getting this past month. Im pretty sure everything is fine and that she is busy but how do I tell myself to calm the fuck down and not worry about how she’s not snap chatting me the same amount. Yes we do snap chat every day. We live in different states and only text each other very often anyway.  I know this probably seems stupid but idk why but I get anxiety on the fact that it’s different and not the same on the communication level between us. "

0,"Does anyone else twitch a lot due to anxiety? Hi guys! I am a person who has always struggled with anxiety, and I ended up marrying someone who has just as bad anxiety as I do (although it manifests itself in different ways). While I have been in therapy and taken medication for nearly 15 years for my anxiety, my husband was never allowed to see a therapist (controlling parents) and never considered he might have anxiety himself until recently, when he started sitting in on some of my therapy sessions and talking things out with me. 

To get to my point....my husband twitches a lot. A LOT. Mostly facial twitches, but lots of whole body jerking type twitches sometimes as well...especially when eating. When he is eating, his body will jerk and his eyebrows will twitch so much that he has to stop and take a big deep breath before he can continue. This is something that his dad does as well, and one of his brothers...so I just considered it to be a learned trait even though his twitching was on a way more extreme level than either his dad or brother. 

But it seems to be getting way worse over the past year or so. We've been going through rough times lately and he's been feeling very anxious. When I have commented that his twitching seems to be getting worse, and that perhaps it's related to his anxiety...he freaks out and says that it's just a thing he's always done and it can't be anxiety because his dad and brother do it too. He comes from a family that doesn't believe in mental illness so anxiety isn't a ""real thing"" to them. So I think his defensiveness about exhibiting anxious behaviors stems from that, which is totally fair. But is this something more than likely caused by his anxiety....or could it be a more serious, medical concern he should get checked out? 

Curious to hear how many others experience twitching or nervous ticks due to anxiety...as my anxiety does not manifest in this way but I've heard it can! "

0,"Sexual improvement on medication I often see people talking about a decrease in their sex drive when they start taking medication so I wanted to share my experience as it's completely opposite. 

Prior to starting fluoxetine in September I wouldn't have sex without having a shower directly before and after, I would only give my husband oral in the shower and sex just made me feel generally dirty and uneasy. 

In the past few months I've become so much more comfortable with sex, I'm able to be more present and engaged without my mind wandering to random things or stressing about the sheets being ""ruined"". I've been more receptive to my husband's advances and our sex life has improved immeasurably. 

I hope this doesn't sound like I'm gloating, I just wanted to share in case anyone else is in the same boat because I was terrified prior to starting the medication that I would become less sexual than I already was. I'm so grateful that I finally sought help. "

1,"Haven't talked to my BPD friend in a while. Should I reach out again? Friend has never said anything about BPD, but after thinking about all his behavior towards me and asking someone who has BPD about it, it seems that he definitely hits all the classic traits of BPD. But yes, it's always been that some day he is super affectionate with me, and some days he is very mean with me...

Anyway. I last talked to him almost a week ago. He got upset about something (I honestly don't know what, but he's had a history of suddenly withdrawing or changing his affectionate nature to cold without any warning when I talk to him sometimes) and then went offline. A couple days ago, I've tried talking to him again (and all I said was pretty much ""Hey, how are you?"") and then he went offline again. 

In the past, when I've reached out to him, he would eventually respond. And...I don't remember if we've gone this long without talking though. Could it be that he's splitting from me permanently? I don't want to lose my friend :( What should I do this time...? Any advice/help would be appreciated.

1,"Does anyone have periods of time where they are okay? The reason it’s been so hard for me to keep up with therapy is because I’ll go through periods where I feel totally fine and not in need of any help.

Then a huge crisis occurs and I blow up and completely change personalities and shock everyone around me and the cycle just continues over and over again.

1,"IOP recovery and BPD in need of opinions/to vent/one question. a little back story...not great at writing this stuff so please bare with me.

I was diagnosed with BPD about 3 years ago and have seemed treatment sense for it off and on, occasionally giving up on a therapist or just deciding to stop. I was arrested for DUI this past April, through the court process it was stated that i need to go to a inpatient rehab facility for alcoholism. I refused and was dropped from the pretrial diversion program i was in. I did at the recommendation of my attorney enter into a highly respected out patient recovery program in the town I'm from. I spent 5 or so months in this program and successfully was sober for 3 months before i relapsed (this happened within the last month). During this relapse i lost my job as a result of drinking on the job and it was decided by myself and along with my IOP group that inpatient is in fact a good option for me, and the process is underway to get into a publicly funded facility (sense i lost my job and insurance) that will be about a month so its kinda useless to look for any decent job so in an attempt to stay busy along with odd jobs i can pick up I'm spending a lot of time at coffee shops studying alcoholism and general interests. One of the things I started digging into the last couple of days is my diagnosis of BPD. When i was first diagnosed i agreed and thought it made a lot of sense but i must admit i didn't do a lot of looking at how it affected me and what exactly it meant. 

In this process of digging into BPD (I'm reading several books ((""I hate you- don't leave me"" and ""Borderline personality demystified""))as well as several good sources I've found through the books.) I am finding a lot of the things that I do can be better explained as a symptom of BPD over a symptom of alcoholism. (yes a part of me is convinced i don't have a problem and don't need IOP, but thats not what this is about). 

The therapist who runs the IOP group I'm in has been told i was diagnosed with BPD, the more i read into BPD the more i feel like he might not know exactly what that means. I have been trying to schedule appointments 1 on 1 with him and he keeps saying he will text me some dates and he has yet to do so. I am growing increasingly disappointed with his reliability and want to express this to him. I feel like he needs to be better educated on BPD but don't exactly know how to approach him on the subject. I really don't know exactly what I'm looking for in posting about this but i feel like i needed to vent. 

I guess for the sake of it I'll ask some more specific questions hopefully someone will have some inside into. 

1) Has anyone of you who suffers from BPD entered into treatment for substance abuse, how has it been helpful for you? 
A big part of me feels like I have yet to really address BPD in an appropriate way and I feel like entering in patient treatment without doing that will only be a waist of time.

1,"Is anybody else easily manipulated, open to suggestion. Sorry if this is vague rambling, but I don't know how to solve this. 

I'm extremely open to suggestion to people close to me. When my friends have an opinion of me, it immediately becomes a truth. I can't/don't really have an opinion about it of my own anymore somehow. For instance; the other day my friend said I gave in to my parents too much and I remember that I thought I didn't, but now I think I do and I'm starting to resent my parents for pressuring me and myself for giving in all the time, eventhough I don't know if it's true. Well, loads more examples were that came from.

The biggest problem is that this also happens in therapy. I can't hold on to what I think of something for myself. I am constantly fighting my therapists suggestions as if they are trying to take my own thoughts away from me, because that's what happens in normal life with less important things too. 

It makes me less prone to share the really important issues, because talking about it will make me confused about what is true, what are my thoughts and what are my therapists thoughts. 

Does anyone relate? How do you deal with this?"
1,"Pregnant and :( I'm 35 weeks pregnant and the father and I aren't together. He's told me his family would consider it their biggest fear if we ended up together. Just now I asked if we could see each other this week and he said no, he wants to get an early night one night and he's out with friends every other night (movies, sports, dinner, art exhibition etc). He said, just tell me what you want to say now over the phone, and I said I just wanted us to talk in person, and he said suit yourself and we ended the conversation. I have no idea when we'll talk.

Up until recently I thought my mom would come over for the birth but that's off now her malignant NPD husband who severely abused me as a child/teenager is back (she has BPD and was equally abusive but I was hoping things might have changed). Nothing has changed in that situation since that time.

I feel so sad and alone. I'm trying to stay positive because I have to for the baby. I have no friends and am totally isolated. I've seen that he (the father) has notifications from dating apps on his phone when we've been together. The more upset and hormonal I get, I feel like the more pathetic and unattractive and unmotivated I am. I have a place on a college course for after the baby's born and he tells me he doesn't think it will be doable, and I have serious concerns about being able to do it with a baby. He is scheduled to get a promotion around the time the baby's due and has given me his friends' numbers to call in case I go into labor and he's not around.

Anyways I have been recently diagnosed with BPD, I will be starting therapy soon enough. My partner of about 6 months knows about this diagnosis and tries his best to be supportive and understanding for me and my behaviour, he knows about him being my FP.

I have no actual reason at all to break up with him but for some reason for about a few weeks now I keep thinking about breaking up.

I feel like this relationship is giving me anxiety but honestly he's been doing nothing but giving me amazing support, even if he's a bit brutally honest sometimes it helps me snap out of times I become emotionally irrational. And in return I want to do nothing but make him happy.

Like the only reason I want to do this is because I often get upset and blow up in tears for the most menial things. It's not even bad things he does, he's just talking to friends most of the time and I get super irrationally jealous. And every time I get upset like that I feel so guilty and he feels bad for hurting me. I just feel so toxic and abusive at times even though I know I'm not... I just keep obsessing over those times I overreacted and it's piling up on me...

I don't want to hurt him anymore which makes me think of doing this, I'm wondering should I wait until I learn to cope better and get my emotions in check before making such a harsh decision, or am I beating a dead horse out of this relationship?"

1,"First time poster seeking advice from other mothers who suffer from BPD My biggest fear in life has always been to end up just like my mother, Who suffers from BPD/narcissism. She had a horrible childhood, and was abused horribly by her father, who also suffered from BPD, and had a horrible childhood himself. I'm not going to say my mother was all bad because she wasn't, and I know she loves me but since she suffers from narcissism also, she doesn't accept she even has a problem, it's always someone else's fault and never hers. 

I cut ties with her completely after I moved out at 18, and had my first child at 19. As my first child has gotten older, I realized that I would get annoyed super fast with her, and I have said stuff to her that I do not mean, and it breaks my heart. I have almost all of the traits of BPD. I am a emotional rollercoaster. My mood is constantly changing throughout the day, the littlest things can make me go from happy, to sad, to depressed, to having suicidal thoughts. 

After reading so many comments about woman who suffer from BPD, make horrible mothers, only get worse, are horrible people, and their children are doomed, makes me have no hope and not even want to get help. I am very good at controlling my emotions around my children, although I have messed up, I have never hurt them and i try to think about everything that comes out of my mouth before I say It. I do not want my kids to grow up and feel the way I do, or have to struggle with losing their cool easily with others.

Have you ever been in a relationship with another bpd sufferer? At the very least someone extremely bipolar and prone to outbursts? Have you made it work, have you tried as much as i am trying? We are starting couples therapy as well. 

I'm apprehensive to call his behavior abusive because i don't really see malice, i see untempered mental illness and instability. However, I've seen through rose eyed glasses before and while im great at seeing signs of real abuse when its others, not so much myself. Right now though, i don't believe it's fair to label it as abusive. I wouldn't be opposed to reminders of what is and isn't tolerable behavior and when its time to call it quits. 

I just need some perspective. Experience. To commiserate? Even advice would be nice, but mostly right now I'm drowning, confused, and need to be heard, to be validated.

TL;DR - HOLY SHIT RELATIONSHIPS. I MEAN WTF. 

Sorry for the wall of text. And thank you for reading."
1,"SSRI’s don’t work for me. anyone else? i’ve tried a few antidepressants (lexapro, prozac, celexa, etc.) and all seem to make me super tired and suicidal. i’ve noticed antipsychotics like latuda work and wondered if anyone else has noticed this? "
1,"please I need advise... I really need help writing a letter to someone. 


The reality of the situation is she got a boyfriend, and they fell madly in love and attached at the hip (as most couples do) and she didn’t have as much time for me. 


But my perception of it for the last year and a half was she completely forgot about me, I never meant anything at all to her, and all my feelings are just burden to people and people think I’m annoying and delusional.



To some it up, I told her to forget my name and number and that she ever knew me a year and a bit ago and I haven’t been able to fucking stop thinking about it since. It really doesn’t help that my sister is best friends with her and I can’t just not hear from her ever (I don’t have social media because it is VERY bad for my mental and emotional well being) also that I am completely and utterly avoidances personality because I feel people never truly love or care for me and will always just leave me always, so its easier to just be alone and too scary to be intimate and I can’t even when I try to be authentic so relationships are just draining and painful. This situation hasn’t helped with that obviously.


The last month though I’ve finally been prescribed some anti-depressants and a pill for dissociation and talking with a therapist again. I’m starting to feel a little saner, thank fuck. 


My therapist asked me if I could to write a letter as if I were to actually write and send this letter to said friend. 
Reality is I would reach out to this community for support and advise so here I am. 


Its hard for me to remember the massive tsunami wave of emotions I have and have had for over a year relative to this because of the medication and not being in a triggered state for the last week. But I really do want to write a letter expressing myself and letting her know that its not her fault. I know that its me and I have a lot of work to do to challenge myself into a better place so I don’t make this same mistakes again. I’ve had a similar situation with my mom in the past which carried on for years and still to this day where I carried actually life threating hurt inside me. I don’t feel I can move on without making some type of amends with her. I've been having suicidal thoughts all steming from this for a year and need to move on. 

a few weeks ago I was triggered because my sister was in town so I was able to go on her phone and creep people on Facebook and I creeped this friend and she seemed so great and happy and thriving without me. I’m not upset that she’s happy. I care about her and I’m happy she’s happy. It just that I feel so god damn unlovable, sick and diseased. No one will ever be able to love me. 


I have no idea her perception of all this because we really haven’t spoken in the year and a half. 

I made a post a short while ago relative to this but didn’t get any comments you can read that if you’d like:

1,"BPD is costing me my job. Looking back at all of my relationships, work, personal, etc. I feel like everything was a trainwreck.

The only one I'm willing to discuss today is more on a professional level because it's my livelihood. I never had a good working relationship with anyone. I had this honeymoon phase with someone when I first start at a company, then slowly turn sour as I get to know people.

In my current situation, my emotions got out of whack, I went to see a psychiatrist, got medicated, but no proper diagnosis. My emotions are everywhere and uncontrollable. I ended up being intellectually slow which is costing me my job. Since I disclosed my disability to my employer, they can't fire me under Human Rights, but I feel humiliated and traumatized by my whole situation. They have been trying to get me fired. I saw evidence of a case they are building on me.

My PMs have been setting me up for failure. All achievements are negligible. Anything tiny that I have done wrong puts them in a hissy fit and magnifies my mistakes by 100x. I wasn't given everything that I needed, I wasn't trained properly to do xyz, they won't help me when I ask for it. They've been pushing me into a corner to get me to quit.

I'm away on medical leave and I can't even bring myself to think about going back to work. With Canadian healthcare, it's a year long wait to get treatment.

I'm low on money and I don't know what to do anymore."
1,"how can i help my neurotypical s/o understand my mental illness? im concerned i could be hurting the otherwise healthy, loving relationship we have.."
1,"Therapy help? I distrust people who work in any medical field until they have proven to me they are ok, due to shitty experiences in the past. But I really need to try again w a mental health professional. I need a diagnosis, meds adjusted, and help dealing with my new psychotic symptoms. 

How do I know If i can trust a new therapist? How do I get a therapist to work with me the way I *know* I need, not act bored when I talk and say things that are at best useless and at worst actively harmful? How do I explain to a therapist what seems to be wrong, without skewing my symptoms so I get the answers I want or expect? I want to get something out of it this time. "
1,"Barely getting through the day. Pretty straightforward. Mourning love lost has to be the hardest thing I’ll have to do this year and I’m not fairing well at all. I can’t get out of bed without crying. I’ve shunned all of my family and friends. I’ve stopped doing things that bring me joy. I feel bleak. I feel lost and alone and defeated and broken. I don’t know what to do. The pain gnaws at my heart every waking moment and alcohol seems to be the only thing that can quiet my volatile thoughts and insatiable cries. 

We don’t do well with abandonment and rejection and good byes. Hopefully someone here can relate. Anyone that has ever truly loved another human and lost them will relate to this, probably. I just want him back. But I can’t always get what I want. And it’s killing me. I want to tear my hair out and cry until I lose my voice. And curse the fucking universe for dealing me these bullshit cards. And telling god to go fuck himself for putting the most amazing human being in my life, only to tear him the fuck away from me. And to genetics for making me into the insecure, explosive asshole that drove him away. Fuck.  "
1,"I wrote a poem describing my struggles with BPD. It talks about using art as a way to cope with the constant emotional pain. A stare into space 
A wrinkle on your face 
Sends me into panic 
A feeling I've learned to embrace 

Did I stutter 
Did I groan 
Did I hurt you 
I hear your moan 

The paranoia and dread 
Fill the brim of my head 
Like an old glass of wine 
Bubbling over with red 

I go back to my cave 
I sit and think awhile 
But nothing is resolved 
So I give the mirror a smile 

It's all I can think to do 
To tame the taunting bruise 
Of thoughts past and present 
Of neuroses forever new 

My cave is where I sleep 
But rest I cannot keep 
I wake with achy eyes 
A fate I gladly reap 

But maybe the lack of sleep 
The rest I cannot keep 
Will be buffered slightly by 
The gift that I must reap 

Maybe that gift is cursed 
Maybe it's all for naught 
But the aching obsession remains
To fight for what's been fought

Beauty is in the mind 
It's not out there to find 
So here in my cave I'll rest 
And fight for one more time

1,"Do you have hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia? Hello all. First time posting here, so hopefully this is okay. First of all, I know absolutely nothing about BPD besides what I've read on wikipedia. I was diagnosed with schizoaffective about a decade ago and that's been my stable diagnosis since then. I recently started seeing a new psychiatrist. She says it could be borderline. From what I've read, the symptoms don't seem to match. The reason that I've been diagnosed with schizoaffective is that I hallucinate and have delusions and paranoia. From what I've read, that's not characteristic of BPD. Am I wrong? Do any of you hallucinate or have paranoia and delusions as part of your BPD?"
1,"Needing to be needed, and then proving why others can't trust needing you in the first place. I have to call myself out on my behaviour and talk myself down from whatever moment I just had. The Mrs is going through something traumatic for the past month or so. It's been a nightmare and I've not been much help to her, though she'll say otherwise (emotional support and that). Her strength has been something else!  Through everything, she's been fierce protective of her close circle, when it should be the other way around. 

Tonight was no different. She's getting ready to take on another round of legal phone calls tomorrow, pertaining to injury sustained and medical costs. She's doing her best to not worry me over finances. I'm feeling useless once more, and decide to treat us to some Italian takeaway once finished with work. I get home and realize I'm after leaving the food I'd picked up for us in the cab home. Food left in cab = none of this would have happened if she didn't make me feel so goddamned useless = I lost my absolute shit on her and threatened to leave her since she didn't need me and could handle herself so well without me.

So here I am, after roaring it all out, ordering us another round of dinner and having the absolute mother of all anxiety attacks over going back home.  She was crying when I left. I feel like an absolute c*nt.  And I don't know what to say for myself when I get home.  I'd never leave her, I don't know why I even said such a horrible thing. But I felt that way in that moment. Was that splitting?

Making a balls of 2018, and it's just begun lads. "
1,"It's happening again. It's ruining me. I met this guy online, he's in florida I'm in the UK. Everything was great at first. He was the sweetest ever. Understood me. Took the time to talk me down when I was upset. 

Now it's like am just a chore to him. Past month I've realised how little he wants to talk to me. I'll still texts saying he love me, but he'll always use convo stoppers, just sent one word replies and shit. 

He never calls me anymore. We used to video chat for like 10 hours everyday. The past 2 weeks I've spoke to him for about 20mins. When I ask he says he's not feeling well, or he's busy. 

I tried my best to keep it all in. Up until I received the daily 'I love you' text today, and I tried to create conversation and all he replies is a love heart emoticon. So went crazy. I couldn't not. Out of my control. This guy is the love of my life. He is clearly drifting away. So I said 'HAHA YEAH HI, LOVE YOU, BYE. NOT EVEN SPOKE TO YOU IN OVER A WEEK. YEAH FUCK ME OFF' 

And then he was like 'wtf. Seriously wtf? I'm sick of your abusiveness, why do you think we never speak anymore'

Well.... I can't work out what it is I do that is abusive, like I constant say nice things to him. This sent me over the edge I was like 'well that's all I need to know. Bye I'll be off. Fuck this world'

And so he calls me, it's like I have to threaten suicide to get him to speak to me. And he's being so nice. He's telling me I just need to relax and breathe. He says no matter how much I push him away that he's not going anywhere. We spoke for a whole 20 mins, I began to calm down he said he loves me and thinks about me constantly. Then he was like 'hey I'm just gonna eat some food and I'll call you right back, ok love you'

7 hours I have been waiting for this dick shit to call me. Every time. This keeps happening. I was literally sat waiting. I thought right, this is pure taking this piss. And so I have text him saying 'this is not enough, you're making me worse and I love you so much which is why this is not working'.

2 hours ago I sent that. He's not even read it yet. He doesn't work, it's not like he's busy. He just sits at home watching tv. 9 hours ignored for someone who apparently 'is constantly thinking of me'. Bullshit. He'll pretend he fell asleep or something, honestly from what he texts me he is literally only awake 1 hour per day. Which I find very unlikely. 

I feel like saying a whole lot more to him. But I'm trying my best to stay sane. But I think it's past that point. 

I regret sending that last text. Damn I'm so on the edge. Like he was my way out of the crap life I am living. He is my everything. I love him so much and this is what I get.

Damn I just want to die. I can't keep doing this. All my relationships I'm fucking up and I don't know what I'm doing. Now I'm losing this amazing guy. I just want to kill myself right now. I have no one. "
1,"Musicians, Music and BPD For a long time I have wondered how many creative people, especially song writers have diagnosed/undiagnosed Borderline PD. It’s well known that many people with bipolar are highly creative. But I often think about borderline creativity, especially when it comes to music. If you think about the lyrics  in popular music, that everyone relates to, because it totally explains how they feel, it all seems to come from such a Borderline perspective; The  deep emotion expressed in music and lyrics; the songs about the euphoria of falling in love and the pain and devastation of breakups, and the general drama of relationships. I often listen to music, and think this song must have been written by someone with BPD.....normals don’t feel emotions this intensely! "
1,"Can't stop checking up on ex FP's instagram Its been about 1.5 years since I was cut off from my FP.  Weird situation but he was a married man, which was trouble waiting to happen.  He was my best friend for 2 years prior to messing around though....  I took things too far with him and his wife cut me off from him.  Last time I saw him we had a huge fight and he treated me like garbage.  He was so fed up with me that he told his wife everything.  He regretted it later as he tried to make amends with me. We were such close friends too.  He didn't block me on instagram though.

Anyway Its painful because I see everything he's up to, and he's slowly accomplishing all of his life dreams. He seems to love his wife again too, but she is controlling so he might just be trying to stay on her good side.  I know that he misses my friendship because he still hints at inside jokes we used to have on his posts.  It's really messed up because I hate him for being an abusive asshole but I also miss him.  I wish I was a strong enough person to move on but every day is mental hell.  My happiness is directly correlated to his life..the better he is doing, the worse i feel.  Ive lost most of my friends because of my avoidance, and I don't know who I am.  I wish I could just be like him....compartmentalize my bad feelings, work on my hobbies and move on.  But I'm just a weird anomaly of depression, emptiness, and contradictions.  I also cannot stop thinking horrible things about his wife...I know that it doesn't matter but I keep thinking immature shit about her looks...she's really not attractive at all and I know that he is ashamed to be seen with her.  I even wrote his wife an apology a few months ago, and she accepted it.  But I feel fake because I still dislike her and even if I was to see him again I'd have to spend time with her.  

I'm 25/F and he's almost 40. I just want to be free from this hell and accept the fact i'll probably never see him again.  He was the closest friend I ever had, I wish I never took it so far.  He used to tell me that I was the most amazing person he's ever met, and I felt the same about him.  Put sex into the equation and I turn into a devil woman.  I’ll never find anyone as unique and funny as he was. I’m an oddball and I’ve always had trouble connecting with others.  I’m a very attractive woman but all of the men I’m interested in are unobtainable. My future looks very lonely, just me hanging out here with my mom well into my 30s."
1,I want to message someone from the last time I ghosted on a city I still have her on one of my old facebook accounts and im so bored I feel like messaging her to see what would happen. 
1,"It’s 12:29am on my 17th birthday and I just started bawling My eyes just welled up with tears and I tried sooo hard to not start crying but after 2018 being the absolute worst year of my life after losing one person that basically broke me into a million pieces, and always having mood swings and anger issues and anxiety and so many other problems, I just got an overwhelming amount of messages from people who love me.


It really hit me that through everything shitty I believe myself to be that there are so many people that love me and would do anything and everything for me. 


When I feel like I give nothing good to anyone. It hasn’t even been a half hour into my birthday but I’ve gotten so many long, thought out messages full of love from people that I thought couldn’t care less about me, telling me how amazing I am and how much I am worth to them. 


I am just so broken because of the things that happened to me in 2018 but there are people who love me with everything them and I can’t comprehend how or why but they just do....."
1,"Avoid narcissists. They're even more damaging for you, than for non-borderlines. At the very least, think of the ones who are in your personal company. Story inside. To clarify, for a borderline person, I am actually quite good at making everyone think I am not a chaotic mess of emotions. Like, I almost make sense on the surface -- at my *worst*. 

 I wish I knew what a narcissist really looked like before this went down. My parent went NC with my extremely narcissistic grandparent, long before I had the skills to observe and learn from afar. 

My friend was a total nightmare. They were an unrepentant emotional vampire, and masterful at gaslighting and baiting. I was actually far less self aware, and was more naive while also being lonely and desperate for a change of pace in my stagnating life, at the beginning of this rollercoaster. So even when I looked, I didn't fully want to *see* what was going on for a few months. 

We ended up feeding each other's deeply ingrained self hatred and insecurities, ping ponging abuse roles, and it twisted me more and more. I started becoming outwardly sullen and withdrawn, and letting it show, instead of keeping it tightly contained, deep down inside. 

I finally couldn't take their abuse, my pain, good people's pain... I cut off my friend rather abruptly, with zero closure. I haven't actually said a word to them since. Although I did have some fun manipulating them to make a fool out of themselves, later, while I looked like the good person, silently ""ignoring"" it all. 

It caused them some mental anguish. I know it's ridiculous, and the pesky  ""how are you any better, if you do this? Can't you just move on instead of giving them attention?"" question arises... but,  just, uhm, yeah. They thought they had won. After all, I was the one with all the inner agony while we were friends. But I'm past that now. 


To conclude, avoid narcissists at all costs. They have a way of getting the worst out of you, unless you're very solid. And you try to blame them to the ones whose your moods affect, instead of accepting any accountability in the aftermath. 

It's all left me rather disturbed at myself. I no longer have... anger like I used to, but I learned rather uncomfortable things from the self-inflicted ordeal."
1,"My heart aches I need a hug Now that I deleted my Tumblr blog, this is the only place for me to go to I guess

please make it stop "
1,"TEXTING SUCKS hello fellow borderlines, does anyone else just have a fucking internal meltdown when people leave you on read??? I’ve been romantically talking to this guy for like a month now and he’s so bad at responding to my messages although in person he’s so sweet. I know I’m being ridiculous but I can’t help but feel so crazy and anxious that he doesn’t like me anymore just because he hasn’t texted me all day. 

I don’t want to seem so clingy and such so early in the relationship but it’s driving me crazy. Honestly just wanted to vent to someone who might relate to how crazy I feel. Why do I have to have such intense feelings about trivial things like text messages? "
1,"New year new psychotic break?? I locked myself in during nye. I had a panic attack. All in all I’m just getting worse. I’m splitting TOO MUCH. More than before. I’m a menace to my bf. I hate myself for it. Yes sometimes he does provoke me and is oblivious, but the other times he’s just trying to help and I have breakdown after breakdown. I don’t know what to do. Last night I tried to end it again. He and I joke about how I can’t go more than 3 months before making an attempt to gain better perspective on life. My actual family has ostracized me. They only want me in their life to gaslight me. I’ve accepted the fact that I’m going to die alone, but I’m trying to find friends "
1,"BPD (mixed type for me) seems to bring on these extreme ""reminiscing"" moments frequently in life. Tonight is yet another one. This may sound dumb. It's embarrassing even taking/writing about it.

Just got to thinking tonight about how many friends I had in my late teens, early twenties (early-mid 90's) that I'll never see again. One or two have passed, most I don't know where they even are now, a few live on the other side of the country and haven't spoken to since, someone who I never would have guessed is pursuing a PhD, many I could never even reconnect with due to not being part of that religion anymore.

It's funny how life works sometimes. All these memories I have with this fairly large group of people back the, that I did a TON of shit with together throughout those years. And never imagined life would take the turns it has. Never would have imagined that *not one of them* would be in my life, to any degree, 20 years later.

Sometimes ... I want to ""rewind"" time to experience certain moments again. Not to change something, or even ""right a wrong"". Just to *experience* it, because I miss it. I feel like I want to freeze time. Or that I have an extremely hard time growing older, and processing change. Changes in friends, dynamics in the family. Whatever.

It can't possibly be normal to process things like this, can it? At least not too this degree. I don't know, maybe it's one of those weird days, or I'm just more fucked up in this particular area than most."
1,"Getting Evaluated Hi everyone. I'm 23F and have a diagnosis of Bipolar 1 disorder. I feel like this is an accurate diagnosis, but doesn't quite explain some things about my mental health. I do have a relative with BPD and the more I read this subreddit and learn about it, the more I think I may need to get evaluated. I see a psychiatrist for  Bipolar and a therapist for OCD, and neither of them have brought up the possibility of BPD. However, I see symptoms that can't be explained by OCD or Bipolar, like a big fear of abandonment by my friends, *extremely* quick mood swings, having an FP I rely on, etc. etc. 

Long story short, I'm just wondering how you all got evaluated and diagnosed with BPD? I don't think my psychiatrist treats patients with it. At least they don't evaluate for it. I want to find a psychologist/therapist who does DBT and maybe I can get evaluated there. Even if I don't have BPD I want to do DBT for bipolar symptoms. But just wondering what you all did. Thanks :)"
1,"How do I tone down behavior toward new FP and treat them like a regular friend? For context, I'm very self aware of my habits and patterns but I can't stop feeling like a complete nut. I think about this person the second I wake up and all day until I go to sleep. I analyze every interaction we have, every text they send. I'm convinced they're about to be sick of me and just not telling me. I tried to quit texting them for as long as possible and told myself they had to text me first for me to give a shit, but I caved after like a day. Every time they text me anything I feel like a dehydrated person squeezing the dregs from a wrung out sponge into my mouth. I hate this and want to just be normal good friends with them! 

This is half venting/half asking for advice. I'm on mobile and sleepy so sorry if it's not that coherent."
1,"I'm going to lose my fucking mind. I'm completely incapable of interacting socially with others. I can't do it, I either exist silently or I speak too much. My brain is going to explode.

1,"Do you get addicted to good sex? Realized recently that my girlfriend has bpd. It’s not a problem for me because I have my own set of problems and we got along but there has always been hiccups. Now the thing is whenever we have sex I usually give her multiple orgasms and I am in way better shape than her. She doesn’t really workout, and me as a male spend most of my days working out and am in visibly better shape. Whenever we have sex she treats me like a god the days after but I’ve been busy a little bit lately and then she had her period so we haven’t been doing it and she’s been throwing tantrums. Is this a normal bpd thing or just a normal occurrence. Curious "
1,"BPD sadness my girlfriend is randomly sad pretty much out of the blue. neither of us know how to help her since she hasnt covered this in therapy. any advice anyone? basically just sad for no reason but apparently a result of BPD. this time i tried being kind of a dick, as in she said “idk how to make this better” and i said “sure as hell not sitting in a ball and crying” not in a rude tone but in a serious tone i guess idk but its not helping any advice appreciated"
1,"I Write To Help Cope. Before you fuck up a stranger, stop and think.
Was this path meant to cross yours,
And if so, to what extent?
Will you over-share, display your worst qualities,
Be physically demanding, emotionally exhausting,
The ""toxic friend?""
Will they have to pry themselves away from you mentally,
To just find some rest?
They gave you their everything, they gave you their best.
And that wasn't enough for this sinner and this saint.
The one who does as they please, yet plays the victim, the saint.
The one we love to hate, and we do,
Indulging in a mindset too addicting and reproving.
There's beautiful faces everywhere, warm bodies for comfort,
Affection to share. 
But you want it all, you do.
And it's fine for you to throw a fit, land a hit,
Throw up your hands and be done with it.
Where does it get you, really?
You find yourself filling the void again.
Again and again to no satisfaction.
My advice would be this year, and the next,
Look at yourself.
Put on your oxygen mask before you star helping others.
Maybe no one will see you as a saint,
But the love you offered will overcome the self-hatred.
You'll get there. You'll be okay."
1,"Need Advice Hey 21 M here, a few nights ago I just got wildly drunk by myself at my house since my family are all away and struggle to cope while I’m alone. I didn’t really feel safe and thought I may do something to myself so decided to call emergency services. Next thing I know is 5 cops rock up to my house and drag me away in an ambulance. Me being drunk I tried to get away when we arrived at the hospital, the police then beat the shit out of me drag me in cuffs into the hospital. Strapped my entire body to the bed and sedated me. Obviously since I was drunk I then vomited all over myself since I was strapped down. I was released the following morning back home and my family and friends now know. But they’re all treating me badly , obviously I did a bad thing but is it wrong for me just wanting to forget? I don’t want to drink anymore and am currently on suicide watch, I have bruises all over my body from the ordeal but they think that I just think it’s a joke? But that’s how I just deal with shit is by brushing it off. Am I wrong ? "
1,"I don’t feel safe (TW suicide mention). But my insurance restarted at the beginning of the year so going to the hospital is not an option. I’m already thousands in medical debt from being in the hospital last year. 

But I also feel like I could easily make an attempt on my life tonight. I have old psych med prescriptions as well as Tylenol I could hurt myself with. I saw my psych yesterday and told her what I was feeling and she said she would adjust my medications but when I went to pick up my new prescriptions they were the same dosage as before (plus it was over $500, again because my insurance restarted). My doctor won’t return my calls, so I’m stuck here being a danger to myself and very emotionally unstable. "

1,"abandonment issues my current boyfriend is constantly reassuring me and being supportive, although i can’t help but think “when’s he going to get tired of me?” there were times where i’ve thought of ending the relationship bcus of my abandonment issues and generally feeling like i didn’t deserve him, but i remind myself its a temporary feeling. i feel like i’m a chore to deal with and that i’m undeserving of love. maybe it’s because this is the first healthy relationship i’ve ever had (my previous exes emotionally abused me) and have that fear of “it’s too good to be true.” even when there’s no reason to be sad and he’s reminding me how much he loves me, i don’t feel loved. i continue to feel sad and i really don’t know why ? the smallest things trigger me too, like if he jokes around a lot i suddenly start to wonder if there’s a hidden message behind those jokes (there isn’t) — i’m a rational person so i can rationalize with myself somewhat but i can’t help how i feel and i hate myself for it."
1,"Is anyone free to talk on reddit chat? Yeah, I know this sub isn't r4r, but I had good and substantial conversations with people the last time I posted this. If you're interested in talking, feel free to shoot me a DM."
1,"Does anyone relate and know what this was? When i was a child i would often feel things speed up, like my thoughts, motions, surroundings - everything seemed to pick up the pace. It would cause anxiety because it felt like my mind couldnt understand what was happening fast enough to keep up with the fast pace. It would last from seconds to about a minute. 
This would often come after an issue with my hearing. I would hear, what i can only describe as like a horse and carriage going over cobblestones. It would be inner hearing, but very intense. This would happen more than the speed thing, but i think (maybe wrong), that the speed thing only occured after the hearing. 

Sometimes it would feel like the room was spinning things were going that fast. Once it stopped things would be normal again. 

The speed thing lessened as i got older and was gone completely by the time i hit teenage years. The last time i had the hearing thing was about 10 years ago. 

It has baffled me for years. So i thought maybe it was all mental and related to BPD. So im asking in hope im not alone with this and somebody understands."
1,"Will traumatic events forever organise my being? Will I just keep acquiring new traumas? Years ago I got into an argument with my Dad. It was our first and only father-son argument. Basically he thought he could crate a perpetually rotating fan for his bedroom and when I tried to explain to him that it wouldn't work he disagreed and did the whole dad-mansplaining thing where he basically made it clear how stupid I was...

I felt extremely invalidated and completely ridiculed and had no way to express it.  I now recognise it as a BPD thing. As a teenager, my neat solution to my crippling fear of abandonment and lack of stable identity was to be the 'smart guy'. This was the core of my identity and when it is affronted or questioned I feel what can only be described as ""dangerous"" to myself and others, like I completely see red. 

Anyway  I sat and drafted him a whole  essay about the laws of thermodynamics and energy/ work and intended to give it to him to explain why perpetual motion was impossible. I never did hand it to him though... I let it lie and things have actually never been the same between us. Meh its his loss. 

Now I feel that this event has been incorporated into my anxieties. I relive this trauma over and over... not by replaying the event as you'd maybe see in PTSD, but instead in the sense that it created a new need. I am now forever longing for *any* intellectual vindication. I start pointless arguments. I fantasise about or confect scenarios in which I deliver the final put-down, where I know the secret bit of information, where I am an expert in everything. 

I long for that feeling of someone acknowledging that I am right. I have this amped-up need to be right all the time and cannot tolerate any criticism (I always react with verbal violence). People don't realise that criticism puts me in this awful emotional space. Of probably all mental ilnesses, I think BPD symptoms are the most easy and socially acceptable  to dismiss. Getting people to accept that depression is a real thing and not a personality flaw has been a slog. But BPD? Try again next century - we're so easy to dismiss as histrionic, snowflake, millenial 'crybabies' (hell I think that about *myself* sometimes). 

With BPD it so easy to be traumatised... will I eventually get to the point that I have more needs than I can manage? Will my life missions only ever be to prop up my fragile sense of self?"
1,"Inability to connect? Since my mom passed 3 years ago I’ve had an inability to connect with others. I’ve kind of always been this way, I guess. Never really had friends growing up. Then after my Mom died, and no one was there for me, I cut off all the “friends” I kept around just because - they weren’t good friends anyway. 

But now I struggle SO much just to connect with other humans. People talk to me and it just all seems so vapid and unimportant. And it could be the people I come in contact with — but everyone?? And at the same time I want friends and people to talk to and connect with so badly and it just feels like I’m unable?

But also, I feel like people aren’t really trying to “connect” with each other anymore. I just miss in-depth conversations, I miss the honesty, the vulnerability of connecting with another human. Idk.

Is this like.. a BPD thing like... chronic boredom? Idk. Idk of any of this makes sense. Hard to organize my thoughts sometimes..."
1,Being abandoned by my oldest friend Hurts like a mofo
1,"I should be in a group home, not supervising one I recently started a job as a caretaker for dependent adults in a group home. The more I do the work, the more I realize that I'm expecting these people to do things that I myself barely have the energy for, like making my bed and showering. I moved back home with my parents because, let's face it, I need supervision or I could kill myself. There are times when I just burst into tears at work, and my only saving grace is that I work overnights so my tears go unseen and I can clean up before the persons served wake up. I feel like the biggest hypocrite on the whole planet. Has anyone else worked in this type of field that could offer advice?"
1,"depressed and turned off by intimacy Ever since my breakup, i’ve been in such a mood. Depressed and consistently agitated and triggered by any and all signs of platonic intimacy. I feel listless and empty. Completely avoiding my godmom and any signs that she wants to be close to me. I hate seeing intimacy between other people. Love songs and happy couples make me want to rage right now, I hate everything related so much because that kind of contentedness is romantically impossible for me. i just hate everyone right now and im so incredibly sad and tired of this"

I want him to be happy, it just makes me very anxious and upset for some reason, and I hate that I'm aware of how wrong it is because I still can't snap out of feeling unhappy."

But the older I get, the more I completely lose my shit over the smallest things. As a kid everyone said I was mature for my age and now, definitely not.

She tried to say that before and I said if she threatened that again that I'd stop going, because therapy should be a safe space and not be used against the patient.

So I told my mom I'm going to stop going and she said they'd kick me out if I did. So they're currently in the process of serving me an eviction notice.

1,"Tired of being in constant pain. Does anyone else feel like they have so much regret or want to die more than any other feeling? Either I’m not good enough for myself, I’m not how far along I wan to be in my life, I weigh too much, I can’t have kids, I hate the pain I’ve cause a couple people I care about more than anyone else, I want to die. I always just want to die. Week when I’m manic happy my mood can shift to wanting to die so fucking quick it’s crazy. I feel empty and alone. I have a couple people that care about me but what good is that if nothing else in my life is making me happy? I feel like I’m not good enough to exist. And when blank faces online tell me that’s not true or anyone who doesn’t know me really, it makes me mad like, if everyone only knew what piece of shit I am then they wouldn’t say that. Maybe that’s a delusional thought because it’s definitely it fact and I know that may be myself but that doesn’t change the fact that I feel completely unable to feel better when I’m down like this. I just don’t want to exist. I won’t kill my self this time, but I really wish I could sometimes. I failed like 7 times. I’m sure it’s not going to happen so I’m stuck suffering. I just want to stop this pain. That’s all I want. "
1,"DAE catch their own mind concocting wild yet convincing stories of people betraying them behind their back? It's pretty ridiculous how my mind can be high-jacked like this by something other than what I believe to be my true intention. I stop and acknowledge what's happening in the moment, tell myself that it's not real. Without thinking, I then find myself being distracted with how possible the wild ideas could be! So I stop, again, and acknowledge how preposterous it all would be if it were true. 

*But it could happen...* the voice in the back of my head echoes. 

Shake my head and try to laugh. It doesn't help that I've experienced people betraying me in the past; my psyche wants to stay prepared, is all...But following the rabbit down this hole makes for an ugly time.

What else am I to do? I explain how *unlikely* this would all be, that I have no good reasons to think otherwise, only that I am entertaining melodramatic soap-opera ideas. Do what I can and embrace some faith that everything will be alright...And if things were to be off, I would recognize the threat of danger. 

Honestly, this BPD is awfully distracting and exhausting 

"
2,"Recently “diagnosed.” Has anyone experienced negative impact from diagnosis? After a recommendation I explored the possibility of a PTSD diagnosis with my therapist. Following a bit of Q&amp;A and discussion she indicated she felt that this would be a fitting diagnosis as opposed to my current diagnosis of anxiety/depression. 

She said she could update my chart accordingly or leave it as-is...apparently some people are either uncomfortable with the “PTSD” stigma or they avoid the diagnosis for a lower level (general anxiety, as in my case) so that it won’t negatively impact their work/career. An example she gave was active military - supposedly a PTSD diagnosis ends or severely hampers their future career options. 

As a generic corporate computer office guy, I am wondering if I have my diagnosis corrected from the bit more general “anxiety” to PTSD could I be opening myself up for potential negative repercussions down the road? I know HIPAA is supposed to protect you, but her comment that she could hold off caught my ear. 

Has anyone experienced issues with your career or exploring job options related to this? Specifically, not the symptoms or treatment surrounding your PTSD, but the official diagnosis and designation of such?"
2,"Heard a weird noise, triggered a flashback of an old home invasion. I survived a really terrifying home invasion ten years ago. The guy threatened my life, threatened to rape me, revealed that he had been the person who I had heard sneaking around in the attic the week before (duplex, had a hidden doorway, some real horror movie shit). The cops that showed up were friendly with him and blamed me for living in a bad neighborhood. Totally fucked up my whole world view.

I never feel safe anymore. When I hear a noise (particularly a creak, or the sound of a door or window swinging open), I am immediately filled with adrenaline, I quickly grab something to use as a weapon, and I go full-on crazy mode while I investigate. It's useful sometimes: about two months ago, I heard a woman screaming outside. I immediately dialed 911, ran out of the house in my underwear with a screwdriver in my hand, and scared the dude away. Then the woman ran off, and I just sat there crying until the cops came by.

My husband and I heard a noise about an hour ago, and I immediately investigated the whole house. Checked all the window locks. It snowed, so I skirted around the house and checked for footprints. None. Just a weird noise. But I won't be able to sleep now, and I feel like I'm going to throw up, and my hands won't stop trembling. I'm having flashbacks and I can't turn them off. I'm going to sit here, quietly, for the next two or three hours, all the lights off, with a knife in my hand. Why? I don't fucking know why. Nobody's here. No one is trying to hurt me. But because of that one asshole ten years ago, every time I hear the tiniest sound at night, my brain screams at me: he's back and he's going to kill you this time!

I also feel like a piece of shit because I have a weird sense of pride around this. When I was a kid, I was the BEST hider in hide-and-seek and manhunt. Like, amazing. Other kids would give up and I'd just be crouching in my little hiding place, brimming with glee, and only realize after an hour or two had passed that they completely gave up on me. My best hiding place ever was in a shadow. I stood in plain sight, in a shadow, up against the wall of a house for an hour while everybody walked past me, searching for me. Years later, that's how I survived my home invasion. I hid in a fucking shadow in plain sight. When he walked into another room, I quietly followed him and then hid again, because I thought he'd be less likely to recheck a room he just went through. I'm so proud of that. Isn't that weird?

This is why I made a throwaway account for this post: because I don't know if anybody will understand what I'm about to say/judge me for it. So, I have PTSD, and really bad anxiety. (After the home invasion, I completely broke down and had to be hospitalized--I've been seeing a therapist for years, and nothing I do makes me feel safe.) But I also really like one aspect of this: I feel so fucking capable. Completely helpless and completely capable at the same time.

I'm helpless because nothing I can do will stop the shakes, the adrenaline, the thought that someone's trying to hurt me--but capable because man, if any dumb motherfucker breaks into my house thinking they're going to find an easy victim, they have another thing coming. I can search and secure my whole house in less than two minutes. I know what I can use as weapons, and where these things are, and I make sure they're always close. I have strategies and plans for if someone does actually break in--where to hide, how to escape, how to defend myself. And because of this, I'm always the first person to step in if I think other people are in danger. I always feel like I'm in danger, so it doesn't feel scary to me to help other people. I've done a few good things because of that, and helped a few people. I really like that about myself, and about my PTSD: I'm always ready. I know that's weird.

But for tonight, it sucks. Tonight, I'm tired and sad and angry. I'm sick of feeling unsafe, and of knowing that I'll probably always feel unsafe.

I really needed to talk about this and I don't think anyone I've spoken to about it understands. Maybe some of you will. Thanks for listening.

TLDR: had a home invasion years ago, had some flashbacks tonight, have weird love/hate relationship with my PTSD"
2,"Is it possible to suffer ptsd from reoccurring nightmares? In my childhood I used to have reoccurring nightmares about being kidnapped (even though I’ve never been abducted, *knock on wood*) and I’d wake up terrified.

2,Whats up with attachment? So I'm diagnosed ptsd and bipolar 2. My therapist thinks ptsd is where a lot of my problems are. Does anybody have problems attaching themselves to people?

Its like im always ready for people leaving. Will this ever go away?
2,"I need to go back to the doctor but just plaint don't wanna I was diagnosed with PTSD a few months ago (after dealing with symptoms for over a year and a half).  Due to a shortage of therapists in the area, my Psychiatrist wanted to do my therapy treatment himself.  I went to a couple of sessions and then stopped, because at the last session the guy wanted me to whip out my iPad and use the voice recorder to record everything that happened that day.  He said it would be like putting the trauma in an ice cube so I could deal with it.  Eh?  I just... didn't want to do that...  I changed the subject and we chitchatted about other issues I'm having for the rest of the appointment.  It just felt wrong somehow, and invasive.  I felt like he was trying to satisfy his own curiosity about my troubles, despite my visible uncomfortableness.  

Anyway, I went to the grocery store yesterday and collapsed into a crying mess while trying to put my food away.  I didn't get all the shopping done, even.  My husband went with me today to get the rest of what we needed, and even then I had to take a half a xanax to even get into the car to go.

I really need to see my doctor here.  Should I call and ask for someone else?  He's in a group of people.  The problem is that because of what happened to me (police brutality/stalking) the general public think the police are the good guys and are not understanding when I give them explain that's not always the case.  My doctor was almost treating my fear of police as a phobia instead of what it truly is... PTSD!

This is my first post here.  I appreciate any insight or experience y'all may have with seeking treatment.

2,"nightmares i have horrible vivid nightmares every night. sometimes they're trauma related, but most of the time they're about murder, torture and such depraved things that I can't talk about to anyone. every morning i wake up drenched in sweat, and sometimes vomiting. i have no idea what to do. it's ruining my life. it's gotten to the point where i become scared of people close to me because of their actions in my dreams. i'm so fucked up right now and they just consume me "
2,"Is it possible to have PTSD and not really remember the precise cause / causes? Years ago I was diagnosed by a therapist as having PTSD. Actually, this was almost ten years ago I received this diagnosis. 

At the time, I was in disbelief and thought the guy was a quack. I've never been in combat, never been in a major accident and never had anything extremely traumatic happen to me. Now like may children of my generation (1980s) I was beaten quite a bit by my dad which I know is messed up, and then I was intensely bullied in childhood for several years. But that's the worst of it. I don't think my childhood was exceptional, just frustrating. 

But after speaking with people close to me, and going through the checklist of symptoms, it was undeniable. So I accepted the diagnosis. Eventually I got a prescription for Wellbutrin and it helped me manage many of my symptoms somewhat for the past decade. 

Lately I've been going through some stressful external events and a month ago due to lack of sleep + stress I had a bit of a freakout with somebody I've been seeing. While my behavior was forgiven, trust was rattled, and it made me rethink about my old diagnosis. Lately I've taken extremely low doses of Xanax (.25 mg) during stressful moments  take the edge off and it's been helpful. And being able to have stress-free moments is helping me think clearly.

And sadly, the only conclusion I can make is that PTSD has robbed my life of friendships and opportunities, and will very likely put me in the grave one day if I don't manage it better. 

But it's frustrating because its (1) incurable and (2) I can't even determine what the f--- gave me PTSD.

I want to conquer this, but the last thing I want is to start adding benzos to wellbutrin to do it. It's just temporary. 

I've heard of meditation -- it does not work. Not for me anyway.

Frustrating. Is there anybody else who has this illness but doesn't even know why?

2,"What is ptsd. Please help. I used to have violent anger attacks when I would either curl up into a ball or hit things or bash my head into walls. These actions would activate once a certain level of frustration or stress was met, and I haven't had one since I was a kid until last week. I physically can't control it and I don't know what it is. My face goes numb, like pins and needles, my ears ring so loudly I can barely hear, and I just freak out, hitting myself against things to make it stop. My counselor told me it could be a form of PTSD or panic attacks but I don't know anything about that. Do any of you guys know what this is. It doesn't feel just emotional, I can feel similar physical sensations each time. "
2,"Recent Diagnosis - Guilt Hello everyone. I was diagnosed with PTSD last week. My family has been very supported, my friends I've told have been trying but they don't really understand. This isn't really my main issue right now though. Although the flashbacks/nightmare/panic attacks are scary and terrible, the biggest thing that is eating me up inside is the guilt. 

When the incident that triggered PTSD in me happened, I felt I caused it and am responsible for it (I verbally taunted my father who has been aggressive towards my mother and brother in the past but never me. He responded by physically attacking me). My symptoms are causing me to fall behind school, I am in my last semester of my undergrad degree and I am on track to failing out, I am normally an A student. I am constantly freaking out and unable to see friends that don't know about my diagnosis or make the friends that do feel very uncomfortable. I feel guilty because I feel as if I brought this all on myself because if I hadn't of taunted my father he would not have attacked me. I know rationally this is not true but I cannot shake the feeling. 

Has anyone else experienced this and is willing to give advice. The guilt is eating me up. "
2,"Have I got PTSD? I just want to start by saying I know this isn’t an official diagnosis, but I am currently dealing with anxiety / depression, but I feel like there is something else.

As a child I lived with my mother who was an alcoholic and we would regularly get into physical fights, after that the emotional abuse would start, I don’t want to go too deep. I also want to say that I don’t mean to disrespect anyone, as I know people have been through way more traumatic things than me, but it’s just I can’t sleep anymore without either thinking A) about my childhood or (rarely) hearing my mum shout, even thought I don’t live there anymore, or B) Anxiety about the next day. Are the reoccurring memories part of PTSD? Any help is appreciated.

I also want to say again I feel guilty and sorry if I am just overreacting and being offensive to anyone, please let me know.

2,"How to befriend my roommate after trauma Hey guys
I live with a roommate and I struggle to communicate with him: he reminds me a lot of  the guy that raped me 2 years ago.

I really want us to be friends but every time I see him, i got a huge adrenaline rush and I just wanna run away. It's like my brain is shouting ""get the fuck out"".

The thing is, he's often out, (with friends I guess) and I don't have much oportunities to talk to him.
He probably thinks I'm a douchebag since every time I see him, i try to find an excuse and leave suddenly. Once, I even looked at him, thought of something to say but it didn't come out because I was too terified.

Also, I'm gay and he's so handsome so I guess it adds up to me being affraid of him.
Since my trauma, I'm kinda terrified by guys in general, I don't trust them and feel like they're all predators.

Another thing, I know he's sad about something but I got no idea what. I've heard him crying two times this week and I really didn't know what to do. But he usually looks so confident in everyday life that I really see him as the tough guy that never needs anyone. That's why when I hear him crying, I just stay in my room waiting for him to stop, not knowing what to do. I wish I could help him but he scares me a lot.

Also, I'm French and he's an exchange student from the US. We usually talk in French but I wonder if he would not be more comfortable talking in english.

Do you know what could I do to make the situation any better?"
2,"Some progress? Maybe? Today my therapist explained something to me that kind of made sense. She explained that I have an emotional mind, a logical mind, and somewhere in between the two, I have a wise mind? Has anyone else been explained something like this? I still don’t full understand how I’m supposed to think with the two minds combined or whatever to get to the wise mind, when the emotional and logical mind are constantly at war with each other. Help?"
2,"Day 2 quitting weed, a lot of emotions (x-posted to r/leaves) Hi everyone. So it’s day 2 for me. I started smoking two years ago to self-medicate PTSD. I believe it has turned into an addiction, with me forgoing food and rent in lieu of buying weed (I don’t have a lot of money so I can’t afford this). I think it did help, but has turned into something uncontrollable at this point. I know I can manage my traumas without weed and with healthy coping skills. Today I’m feeling the weight of anger towards people who have hurt me, who have taken away my basic rights as a human being to my own thoughts and feelings. I realized just now fully that when high, it distracts me and I don’t think about all that stuff.

I’m still trying to rebuild my identity. I feel very very very small. I also don’t eat a lot because of stress and have at times gotten to under 100 pounds, which makes me feel so small and weak and powerless in this world. Completely vulnerable. I feel like certain people have taken advantage of me, and shoved me deeper and deeper into the ground, abusively controlling and judging me when no one has any right to make another person feel like this; like everything that I think, do, like, don’t do, don’t like is wrong. I lived with someone who corrected everything I did, gaslighted me, etc. There are a handful of people I got away from but never got the chance to really stand up for myself.

So now I’m looking at this life I have, no money, no car, no place of my own, underemployed…and I just think…it’s been years of being a doormat and look where it’s gotten me. I’m a people pleaser and never make a fuss with people, I’ve become mute in a lot of situations. I’ve been admitted to the behavioral health clinic several times against my will even though I was not violent and I’m literally just a tiny girl. I’ve been condescended to in those places, belittled, threatened, etc.

All of this is coming up and I feel frustrated. I don’t necessarily feel angry at these people, because they have their own problems and if they were happy people, they wouldn’t treat others the way they do. But I feel a sense of wanting to be strong, wanting to build my life, and wanting to finally have my confidence back. I have been made to feel like garbage for how I chew, for how I walk, for how I do almost anything and even though I’m not in that abusive situation anymore, I still act and feel like they are right over my shoulder and I don’t have any say in my own life. As if all my thoughts are stupid.

I do not like to feel this, I don’t like to feel angry. It makes me feel ugly and petty. I know how hard life is, even for the people who have hurt me, and I want to feel nothing but graciousness and forgiveness towards them. I guess being clear-headed today is just bringing up a lot of emotions and I’m so grateful I can share my thoughts here. I hope I will one day feel confident and strong and like my thoughts do matter. By taking care of myself, I hope I can get there. I wish wellness and recovery towards everyone here, thank you for reading :cherry_blossom:

Maybe I’m angriest at myself for letting these people have the hold on me that they did have or do have. Maybe I’m angriest at myself for hurting myself in response to their abuse instead of building."
2,"The monster that is PTSD rearing it’s ugly head So a brief overview, I have a longstanding history of depression and anxiety, and after experiencing a trauma in 2015 and getting a PTSD diagnosis in 2017 things agave been improving. I fell apart in 2016 and lost my career and because of my PTSD my marriage broke down. I’ve finally built myself back up, the nightmares and flashbacks aren’t as often, I have just begun a new amazing relationship and I have started a new career. However I feel like my PTSD has been bubbling for a while and I have done the worst thing and pretended to be ok. Last week I had the overwhelming urge to self harm (something I haven’t done for 8 months now) and now I feel it has hit me. The nightmares have started and although I’m taking mirtazipine at nighttime I’m still waking up, and now I’m starting to feel afraid to leave the house on my own again. The overwhelming fear has taken over me again out of nowhere and I don’t know what to do. I thought I was getting on top of things, I was rebuilding my life and had plans, but now I feel like that shell of a person I once was. I just want to shut the world away and hide. Any words or advice would be very much appreciated right now"
2,"26 yr old, no experience, need to find part time job, on disability For the past twelve years my life has been a big struggle. From middle school to high school I struggled just to show up and get some sort of passing grade. I dropped out and got my ged. 

I have very little support in my life. My current living situation is pretty bad. My ptsd is still really bad. Lots of dissociation, anxiety, and depression. 

But I need to get some sort of part time job. I live in a major city so I have that going for me. My resume is as blank as is gets though. Just even looking for jobs online fills me with tons of anxiety. It's scary, and I feel inadequate. 

I know I'm capable of something. Jobs that involve a lot of people interaction are a no go. I have a hard enough time going to a store on my own accord; it's very overwhelming and draining for me. 

I guess this whole situation feels somewhat hopeless, and I'm afraid of the unknown. It probably doesn't help that I'm too hard on myself. All things considered, I've made a lot of progress. But I'm still in hell. 

If anyone has any sort of feedback I'd appreciate it. "
2,"Need Advice: GF with severe PTSD and Roommates My girlfriend of (almost) 3yrs has PTSD, extreme anxiety, and deals with pretty severe depression. After 2yrs, I finally got her to a doctor so she could start an anti-depressant regiment. I didn’t just push her to do it, thinking it would change everything. When we began dating, we had known each other for a few months (work), and anxiety was apparent. I learned of her PTSD and Depression shortly into the relationship. I deal with depression myself, so I wasn’t about to give up on someone for things they can’t control. I was clear with her of my goal for her in our relationship: to be happy and healthy.

Her family life is almost non existent, and she has moved around most of her life. She severed ties with (some of) the abusive relationships in her life about 2 years ago. We moved in together because we spent most of our time together and we wanted to save money. It’s been almost 2 years living together (after only 8-10 months of dating). Cracks are beginning to show.

We have two roommates, who I like very much. She always got along with them until recently. Our apartment is 2 couples, M-F / M-F. It’s a two bedroom, so yes, it gets a little cramped, even though its a big place, one bathroom is a constant pest. 

Lately (past 6 months), the girl living with us has made it clear about keeping things clean, using our own appliances.. usual passive-aggressive roommate stuff. I’m used to it, I do NOT take it personally from the girl, we still chat in a very friendly way frequently, and I’m good friends with her boyfriend. I see these grievances as small troubles, roommates setting boundaries, etc.

We have lived with this couple for the entirety of us living together. Problems just started to arise about 6 months ago. The girl would get pissed at messy bathroom, moldy stuff in fridge, etc. NEVER became vocal about these problems. Began to show some passive aggressive behavior: Slamming bathroom door, leaving notes, sending TWO texts, JUST TWO over a few months.

I see this stuff as normal, my girlfriend is losing her mind. The slamming of bathroom doors led to her having flashbacks of her shitty father. I spoke with the roommate, and explained the situation. It stopped happening. The girl asked that my GF start using her own electric kettle due to overlapping morning schedules. My GF’s electric kettle was given to her by one of her attackers at her last apartment. That was hard to explain to girl, so we gave it away to avoid more triggers for my girlfriend.

Now, my girlfriend is being triggered by the girl loudly doing her own dishes. This, I had to make a stand on. They were not my gf’s dishes. She had no dogs in the fight. Yet she blamed her INCREDIBLE anger where she stormed into our room and stayed for the night, on loud dish-doing. 

My girlfriend is not a clean person. I can deal with it, try to get her to clean, but it is not my roommates’ fault that she is this way. 

The girl left a note on a tupperware container tonight saying ‘PLEASE DISPOSE’ and my girlfriend lost it. Inside? A month of veggie smoothie mix that had a lump of mold in it so large that I couldn’t wash it down the sink, I had to pick it out and trash it.

My girlfriend? Threw a fit and LEFT IT OUT on the counter. Walked away from it. Meanwhile the moldy cup in the living room I asked her to clean will start a fight if I bring it up. 

The note? She wrote 'FUCK OFF' on it, then threw it away out of regret(?). Left it for me (I guess?) to clean, like everything else.


This escalation between the girl and my GF is getting out of hand. We are moving in 6months. I believe that my GF is overreacting and its unnecessary anger, stress, and confusion adding to the situation. 

I have stood by my GF for almost 3 years. I have read about PTSD, slowly pushed her towards treatment (finally got her to the Dr for anti-depressants, she hadn’t been to a Dr in many many years). I have tried (slowly) to get her to therapy.. we made a few appointments that she canceled (a while ago). 

I feel like my GF isn’t trying. She is being overloaded. She is also being selfish and rude when that is in NO WAY the person I knew years ago. I have been patient with her conditions. I have tried nothing but to help her. I have made stands on some things (almost exclusively cleaning, especially our room that looks like a disaster area, due to her). I’m approaching the end of my rope. Completely ignoring me begging her for years to clean, explaining that it stresses me out the way her triggers do, is starting to really piss me off and make me feel like she doesn't care about my happiness if it means an ounce of work for her. 

**TL;DR** My GF is freaking out over my roommate’s recent actions. I believe it is a completely irrational response. I have taken triggers into consideration, but believe she is being selfish and closing off. I have tried to help her as much as possible, but I have my fears that if this is how she acts now, what will our future (on a different coast we’re moving to) hold. That fear has me questioning our future, viability, health, etc.

Any input would help. I can’t possibly say I fully understand PTSD, but I have tried for years to help her, and plan to continue. I feel insensitive when claiming a trigger or her anxiety in certain situations if irrational, but I truly feel this has been. I can give more specifics about her PTSD. Apologies for throwaway, want to protect her privacy. 

Thanks

2,"Nightmares are getting worse... The nightmares are getting worse. I'm afraid to fall asleep at this point. The screaming has been getting worse and I'm walking up hoarse. Last night I reached a new low. I actually was so stressed out in my dream that dream me dissociated completely, but when I came back around... I'd embroidered my face. Like with a needle and thick embroidery thread. I was sitting in the mirror cutting out the stitches, pulling out the threads, I could feel the string pulling in my skin as I tried to pull it out, and I'm thinking, ""I need to check myself into the hospital. How did I do this to myself? Wtf is happening?"" Then my mother tried to shoot me to death (I was waiting for it) because I'd publicly blamed her for knowing what was happening and letting all my childhood abuse happen. I wrestled the gun away and killed her instead. I mean, good for me for sticking up for myself, but I shot dream mom and dissociated in my dream to the point that I didn't remember SEWING MY FACE. Fucking terrifying. It felt so vivid and so real... I've never dissociated in a dream before and that was creepy too. I lost it and cried for hours after waking up. I'm in therapy and on meds, but life had thrown me some really messed up curveballs lately with my health and it is really affecting me mentally. I don't know what to do anymore. "
2,"Looking for guests for a new podcast willing to talk openly about their experiences with PTSD. I'm in the early stages of starting a podcast that features people talking frankly about what it's like to live with various mental illnesses.

I want to give people a voice to speak about their experiences and help others understand what it can be like to have a mental disorder.

If you're interested, please comment or PM me, and I'm happy to provide more details.

2,"Do Neuropsychologists treat PTSD? I've been looking for a new psychiatrist/someone to help with the medication aspect of my treatment for a few months. Today, I learned that my insurance only covers four people and they're all Neuropsychologists at the hospital down the street. 

Has anyone else been treated by a neuropsychologist for PTSD? In my limited research it seems like they mostly treat conditions like Alzheimer's, MS, Parkinson's, and traumatic brain injuries. I've never had any other brain injuries, so I don't really know how much they'd be able to help me. All the descriptions I find of brain injuries include physical trauma and very little that seemed similar to PTSD.  

I guess what I'm asking is what are the pros and cons of seeing a Neuropsychologist rather than a Psychiatrist? My mom is breathing down my neck insisting that these two doctors are interchangable, but I'm not so sure. Really I just feel lost and stuck in a massive rut. "
2,"Anyone familiar with the Havening technique? I recently found a new therapist who got rave reviews. It seems her and all the therapists who train under her use this technique. Apparently, it's intended to help with trauma/PTSD as well as phobias and fears etc. Prior to meeting her I had never heard of it. I've done some research and if I'm being totally honest it kind of seems like quackery. Any ""therapy"" involving touch kind of signals alarm bells for me though. It's been a while since I've been in this sub, but I was just wondering if anyone has had any experience with this technique? Thanks!"
2,"I watched a coworker die today and it gave me such bad flashbacks. They all told me I sounded calm on the 911 call and during cpr, but now I'm home alone and I can't breathe. He had a family, a wife, children, and my other coworkers were so fucking disrespectful making fun of his name and shit. I'm so mad at them and I'm just reminded of the other 911 calls I had to make. I can't breathe. "
2,"Has anyone had any experience with drawing/painting after being diagnosed? I know of some folks who do a lot of paintings, some do finger paintings with smaller canvasses and acrylics. Some people sell their works even.  I'm not saying I'm an artist, but I want to maybe do some beautiful things with all this pain in my head?

Has anyone out there done painting? What do you do with them?"
2,"Triggered by sounds of things falling or slamming. Just a minute ago, I pushed my tea pot off the edge of my dresser next to my bed, and so it made some stuff fell, and the sound bringed a bad association with the fights my mom would get into with my dad due to his stupidity and/or him refusing to listen to what she has to say, or just being very nasty. During those fights, my mom gets angry and loses it, and will violently throw things and slam doors and just scream at him. And this still happens every once a month or so. I've witnessed this happening ever since I was very young. And I'm also very sensitive to any act of aggression due to my mom.

Just had to write this down to get this off my chest. I can't possibly be the only person who feels the same way."
2,"Hello Darkness, my old friend I was diagnosed with PTSD back in October. Since starting therapy, things started getting a little better. 

Some moments are tough. Each new celebrity sex/assault scandal is a topic of hot conversation with my family, friends, or random people at the bar. But lately, I’ve been *okay.*

Now. Ugh. Hallucinations are coming back. Triggers. My wrists start to itch. My bruises from rock climbing and martial arts remind me of other, past bruises. Nightmares. 

I had such a fucking nightmare last night. Nightmare on top of nightmare. I feel like I didn’t sleep. I’ve been laying in bed for three hours this morning. I missed my office hours. (Not that students ever show up.) I have a lab meeting and class this afternoon. I can’t. I just want to stay in bed and do nothing. "
2,"This is a weird question, but do I have PTSD? Title. I'm super young (15 years old) and already have depression and anxiety that I'm going to therapy for.

A very close friend of mine killed herself in December 2017. She was a sister to me and I'd known her for years. The actual attempt was on the 12th but she didn't actually die until the 16th, she was on life support.


Since then I can't stop thinking about the incident and how I could have stopped it. I keep thinking about her and the first thing I thought on new years was that this would be a year without her. 

It interferes with my life and I intentionally avoid seeing friends that she was close to. I changed my seat for lunch because I used to eat lunch with her there and I don't go there if I can help it. I went there once and was so afraid that I had to get a friend to walk me there. I also get really intrusive memories of the day of her suicide and I can perfectly recall the lunch period on that day.

I don't know if this qualifies as PTSD or if I'm still just normally grieving. Help?"
2,"Period intensifies feelings of disgust Does anyone else feel completely disgusted with themselves when they’re on their period? I struggle with feeling disgusting and not feeling clean most of the time, I hate my body but being on my period seems to amplify it by a million. I feel so much more disgusting and so uncomfortable in my skin, I’m constantly over analysing every little thing about myself. 

I haven’t let myself have a period in coming up to nearly a year. I have taken my birth control pills back to back without telling my doctor because I’m not sure what they would say, I finally thought I should give myself a break to make sure everything is still working fine although it took 3 weeks of pms symptoms to finally getting my period which I guess has made it worse as well. 

Everything about my mental health feels so much worse coming up to my period starting and being on it and I know it’s normal for mood changes to happen but I just can’t deal with how intense it feels. 

It took me months to build up to this but here we are, my mood is a million times worse and the disgust I have for myself is feeling quite unbearable, I want to cut. I know it’s a normal healthy function but that does not change how horrible it makes me feel about myself. 

I feel so pathetic that I find it so difficult.

2,"Recently left a domestic violence relationship, started EMDR, and confused Hi everyone. 

As the title states, I recently left my boyfriend who I lived with for 3 years, who was domestically violent. 

I don’t want to share intimate details in the initial post in respect to others. 

However, since the break up, I’ve had almost no emotions, and I have barely any memories. Has anyone else experienced this? 

I’ve been going to therapy and trying EMDR. I can’t imagine anything when I’m in therapy. She says I have PTSD and alexithymia. 

TIA"
2,"Up from a nightmare at 6 am *domestic violence trigger warning* Sorry no one will probably read this but thank you if you do. This is my first time in a while posting in a forum about this. I was pretty badly beaten for a few years by a partner. I have monthly nightmares about him throwing things at me, cursing at me and threatening me with objects, he did much more but for some reason I usually just dream about the anger and intimidation prior to the actual acts themselves. I think because it was that stage that lasted the longest (an hour or two), it hurt me more mentally than the usual 30 seconds to a minute of when he did hurt me physically, Idk maybe easier to block out than the awful screaming and personal attacks.
I also get nightmares of the cheating and of being an inadequate woman. 

I also have noticed I tend to flinch pretty dramatically when things are thrown or tossed at me when I'm unaware. My depression and anxiety have gotten so bad and I started seeing a counselor last year, and started medication. I've gained  20-30 pounds because i just feel like it's pointless to care about my appearance half the time, my self confidence is really jacked up now. I use to be such a happy person. I always had depression and anxiety but it feels amplified now. It's like I just have a pit in my stomach all the time.

 I use to wear fun dresses and high heels. I use to go on spontaneous adventures. I use to be so carefree and trusting. I'm a fat shell of who I use to be, and it really hurts me when people bring up how fun I use to be. I don't like being unfun, but it's been so hard to dig myself out. I also have 2 young kids which doen't help either lol. I do try,  I try to self care and do what use to make me happy but it just doesn't work.

I recently started therapy and meds for depression and anxiety and it took a few visits to bring it up , I felt dismissed , she said ""he was young"". No I wasn't talking to you to fucking justify it but being on state health insurance it's hard to find good ones out of the few approved therapists in your area. 

Shit when I told my separate doctor that prescribes them that my anxiety didn't feel any better she only had 1 other med to try and then basically said if that didn't work then I just wont have an anxiety medicine that works for me. (We've only tried 2 so far). 

I just wish I wasn't like this. I wish I never went through it,  I wish I could be who I was before everything. I feel like I'll always be the victim now."
2,"A dissassociation confession I know im making posts back to back.... whatever. 

I've experienced dissassociation quite a few times. I never liked it.... so disorienting.... so confusing. 

I remember my first time coming to while conscious. I was teaching high schoolers. I was midstep.... everything changed and I didn't know where I was or doing.... they were staring at me.... It was hard to pick up and function. It was embarrassing too.... I didn't even know what dissociation was yet. 

There was another time I guess I became aware that it was happening while it was happening.... I didn't even know THAT was possible either.... but i documented it. I wrote down my feelings, I wrote down I was not myself, and what made me know this, and what I was experiencing. It was so weird to find that later.... 

I've even had times where it felt like I was ""phasing"" in and out.... or maybe just ""phasing"" but not ""all the way there"" whatever that means.... that's just what I felt. 

I know i hate it. I know its triggered and not something I want....


Hate me for this if you want, but here is my confession: these past few days I wished it would happen. I wish I could numb, and i wish I didn't have to be here. I feel like a disaster for wishing that on myself because I remember and know how tough it is on my mind when it happens.... but i cant help that I feel something because they are feelings.

 I wish I could go away without going away. 

Edit: I'm sorry if none of that made sense...."
2,"Potential Trigger Warning: Break the Dam My past...

Grew up with a father who drank heavy. He was literally Dr Jekyl and Mr Hyde. Drank and took whatever he could find. OD'd so many times. Went into several DTs and that was a rough watch each time growing up... Mother was rapid cycling bipolar, one minute gentle, the next minute violent and destructive. Little brother slipped into substance abuse as a teen and became more physically/verbally abusive the older (and bigger) he got. He mirrored my dad when my dad had the regular one too many. Blamed me a lot for what he did, and did to me. Blamed the family problems on me. It was a constant war zone. Older sister lived in denial most of her life until recently (she finally sought help), so I could never confide in her because, she always said, ""it never happened."" 

First boyfriend wound up raping me when we broke up in college. I broke up with him because he cheated on me, twice. I found out by catching curable STDs. Was stalked for ten months by this guy, met another man during that time who seemed big and strong. Had a temper. He strongly discouraged me seeking help and taking medication, was verbally abusive to me in front of my friends, and physically destructive; he put holes in walls during arguments. Yelled. Walked out or hung up his phone when I became ""emotional."" We broke up, I went into psychosis. Wound up in a hospital room with a gown on and no idea how I got there. They said I must have had cyclic MDD all my life. They urged me to go to women's shelters. Ran away from home that night instead after denying SI and being discharged. 

Couch surfed until I was taken in by a family with a father who became increasingly controlling of my wareabouts. He started saying inappropriate stuff to me without his wife around. He was very controlling with his wife; she was a broken woman. I dipped, worked under the table, lived out of my car and couch surfed again. 

I wound up with a man who never really stood up for me. But he got me out of the street. He was very meek. He used to wrestle me down or shove me into the bed when I became upset about things. Put me in bear hugs when I panicked. But it was stable. He supported me more than harmed me. He just never stopped the harm of others...

I continued college. Went into nursing school. We moved in together to a former roommate's place. This roommate would later go on to commit several sexual batteries against me and ultimately forced entry and assault on me in a drunken rage because I ""cockblocked"" him. That was in 2016. 

It lead me into another psychosis and several episodes of attempted suicide followed with institutionalization. There, I got diagnosed with PTSD. Since then I developed the need to self medicate. Almost nightly. Insomnia still looms. 

I have never eaten much as a child, was consistently underweight growing up. Food is not enjoyable to me unless I have the munchies. I sometimes take a few hits from a pipe just to get a full meal in for the day. Otherwise, it's constant force feed and pecking. I don't step on scales or track my calories. It's not nervosa. I just can't find the energy. Cooking is sometimes triggering because of my recent attacker. It's always hard to shower. To get out of bed. It hurts to fake a smile. I cry once a day. I hear thoughts all the time. I remember these horrible events vividly, if I remember them. I ""daydream"" all the time. 

Sometimes I ""daydream"" the traumas. I ""daydream"" what ifs. They turn sour. The 2 cats in my apartmrnt bring me back to reality. I have a supportive boyfriend. 

I have constant quiet conversations alone to people. Whomever I want to talk to. I have been doing that as long as I can remember. Sometimes they get a little too real and I catch myself going from a whispered convo to loud talking. I grow agitated when they yell. Active imagination, mom said. Roommates poked fun at me for it. I forgot where I was when I did it, was someplace else and not ""here."" 

I work as a full time nurse, a fledgling with 1 year of experience. They say I catch small details, I make a lot of ""good calls."" I find money on the ground all the time, I hang my head a lot and dislike eye contact. This year I found $22 in bills. It's only February.

I'm finally realizing I need help, really badly. I have worked to gain stable resources. But I'm terrified to take the step. But it's painfully necessary. It's a long time coming. It's an ineffective coping. It's a wound needing lancing.

Thanks for reading."
2,"When you have PTSD and then have another traumatic event how do you cope? I've had PTSD for a long time due to various traumatic incidents in my life, just too many to list. I honestly feel like I've lived a cursed life. In November I experienced yet another extremely traumatic event. I've been in therapy a long time and had made so much progress. There were days I was actually happy and not a mess. Then the event happened and it's like everything I worked for was gone. I'm worse than I ever have been. I started seeing a trauma therapist but I just don't feel like I can handle it. It feels like the trauma is ongoing and won't end for a long time because of hearings and court dates and the thing I dread the most, a trial. I'm at the point I don't even want justice, but everyone around me is pushing me along saying I have to do it to protect any future victims. I've been such a mess I have almost been hospitalized multiple times for suicidal ideation. I a lot of times feel like I wish my attacker had succeeded so I didn't have to go through all this. Do I have to start all over from the beginning? I know I need to quit using heroin and other opiates but if I don't I feel like I can't stand to exist."
2,Friend That I Suspect Has PTSD But Can’t Be Diagnosed I have a friend from school that I’m 99% positive has PTSD from researching this extensively. They come from a very eastern family and they don’t believe in any mental disorders along with believing therapy is for crazy people. I feel so angry at them because it affects someone they should care about. I really want her to go to a professional and seek out a diagnosis. But her family can’t know. I have no idea what to do at this point. I believe treatment would help tremendously.

2,"bad panic attack in front of friends i have PTSD from childhood sexual abuse. i was molested multiple times and had forced oral sex(i don't know if that's considered rape) my friends and i are really close and they know about my history. we were watching a documentary on netflix about porn stars, it was fine until they started talking about porn stars acting in a facial abuse scene. they showed a scene about it and i asked if we could skip the part and so we did, then there was a scene about the girls talking about rape victims and saying how they must feel bad about themselves and i was really uncomfortable. they proceeded another scene about another forced blowjob, it wasn't too graphic but enough to trigger me. i was laying on the couch with them and we were all cuddling and i started shaking really bad and it was hard to breathe and my heart was beating so fast i thought i was going to faint. i didn't move and i didn't say anything i just froze. my friends turned it off asked if i was okay i said yes and then i left to go home because i didn't feel like myself. i was all panicky going home and i basically ran out of the car into my house. i'm really embarrassed that my friends saw me this way, we've texted since but they haven't mentioned anything. i've just been in this really bad funk since watching the documentary with them. i was doing much better before this, i just feel really on edge now.

2,"My “first” flashback? Hello, long time lurker here just wanted to ask a question.  I am a mental health worker. I have seen some really messed up stuff.  I don’t like to say I have ptsd because I feel so many people have been threw worse.

Anyway here it is. I dissociate all the time, that’s normal and I have an ok handle on it. However, a recent law suit brought up on a previous employer has stirred up some serious feelings.  My wife and I were discussing I should write down what I remembered for the court date, that’s when I teleported...

I was there, again, watching that poor child suffering.  I wasn’t on my couch at all anymore.  When I came back I just looked at my wife and said somethings wrong.  I phased back and forth a few more times. Took some alprolozame to relax me because I felt a possible full blown panic attack coming on.  Really scared me...

If that happened when I was driving I’d be in a car accident no doubt.  A lot of clients are also triggering painful memories.  I tried counseling but they just focus on pills. Porazin, spelling off just started taking it, is the only mild relief I get beside the well known natural cure.

What is going on? Was that a flashback, if so my god it was pure terror.  I found a whole new respect for folks who suffer worse than me. Should I have this guilt for dealing with PTSD?  I am considering hangin up the degree because I can’t help people with out it destroying what’s left of my fragile grip on reality."

2,"How to be a more supportive partner My husband has PTSD that manifests predominantly as sleep disturbances (He has not slept through the night in approximately 1 year. Maybe longer) and episodes of severe depression. He has just started seeing a private therapist and also occasionally goes to a VA support group. He refuses any medication due to prior negative experiences with SSRIs. Recently his depression seems to be worsening and I dont know how to help. I'm dealing with my own anxiety and depression issues (Postpartum related; I'm also in therapy and undergoing CBT) and I'm really struggling to be supportive. He sometimes stays in bed all day and I feel torn between anger because I need help with our home and children and being compassionate because I know he is trying. For those of you out there who have struggled with PTSD and depression, what did you need most from your partner? Did you feel supported? Was there any specific practice that brought more harmony to your relationship (ex. Set routines, dedicated alone time, etc)?"

2,"Worst therapist I've experienced in my LIFE (TW: Rape) Guys, I'm FUMING right now. I saw a new therapist for our first session today with the idea of doing some EMDR. I'd done some research and found someone in my city that looked like they had the experience and would be able to help.


Despite listing herself as a specialist and my contacting being specifically for the purposes of CPTSD, our first interaction was for her to compliment my parents on the choosing of my name. I told her that I was looking into changing it and she look flustered and back tracked.



We start talking about family and how I'd experience little support, if any, and each time I visited or spoke to them it's nothing but denials, invalidating everything I say or think or remember, and insults. When the topic was raised of how last year I had woken up to being raped by a female friend, she said that as I had taken MDMA earlier in the night, I'd made myself more vulnerable and had some responsibility to take. I WAS FUCKING ASLEEP. HOW THE FUCK IS MY TAKING ANYTHING GOING TO MAKE ME MORE VULNERABLE THAN BEING GODDAMN ASLEEP?!
She also corrects me to say that it wasn't really rape, but sexual assault. When I ask her to clarify, she says that because in this instance it was a woman doing this to a man that even though it's horrible, it's sexual assault because women can't rape men. 
She tries to explain why EMDR works and fucking makes something up using an explanation of left and right brain as creative and analytical working together.
She asks me to think of a time I felt safe, and when I tell her that I don't know what safety feels like because nobody has ever stood up for me and I've always had to protect and defend myself, she tells me thst im exaggerating and that there must have been some time I felt safe.
And to round off this shit hour, she ends the session by saying that all things happen for a reason.


What the actual flying monkey fuck happened to me today, guys? Why is this the kind of experience I have everytime I go to see a therapist?
How can someone be dealing with trauma professionally for this long and STILL be that judgemental and clueless?"
2,"I saw him on the bus yesterday, more shaken today than yesterday I think it would be safe to call him an abuser at this point, I wont detail anything but I think its really true. He sexually abused me and emotionally manipulated me and I need to see that for what it is.

He was my boyfriend for two years, I broke up with him because I felt unsafe around him and I told him that. He decided the best way to handle that was to show up at my house and offer to talk it out in person, so I huddled in my room and cried while I texted him to go home.

That was over a year ago, I put up so many walls and mde so many excuses for him over that time because it has to be my fault and not his, but it is his fault, its all on him. I had myself so convinced I was doing better, I wasnt scared to be on campus anymore, I was considering dating again, my therapist said she thinks twice a month appointments are better for me now because I was doing so good.

But I saw him on the bus yesterday and I panicked the whole way home, had flashbacks on the rest of my ride and in the kitchen while I was trying to make lunch, but I told myself he isnt here, he cant hurt me, and convinced myself I was okay. Im not. Ive been so dissociated in the last 24 hrs, throwing myself wildly into whatever my current task is, except now where all I can do is lay in bed and have these flashbacks and wish I had the strength to do my homework due tomorrow.

This isnt something Im over, and Im scared, and I dont know how to cope with this. All that happened is I saw him, I shouldnt be crying in bed after two hours of flashbacks. I should be okay."
2,"Flashbacks Was watching tv, seems like a simple task, but then (medical drama) during an episode a similar trauma occurs and it shows the whole ordeal, as well as what happens after (having to tell relatives that a certain person is dead, etc.) and just kinda went into a panic attack., having flashbacks and anxiety through the roof. This is hours after my most recent therapy session and now I just feel so mentally and physically drained. Just kinda sucks to continuously go through this after 2 years. I feel like I’m becoming a burden. "
2,"NSFW Missing Gap in My Memory So, I have this gap in my memory from when I was around 7-8 years old. My parents have filled in the more significant parts of the gap, but most of it is totally lost to time minus a trip I took that I only remember because I threw up on a stuffed tiger that I kept by me at all times and it got a bit discolored from it and I had to leave over it (totally... Sanitary?)

Most of this filling in had to do with a number of disturbing things. From me seeing people in the shadows (not monsters like, living breathing people that radiated malicious intent), I wouldn't sleep, I constantly cried, I started peeing my pants, and a couple more things I think were genuine hallucinations. I even slept walked into my parent's bedroom and asked my mom if killing her would break her love for me (my parents aren't liars by the way, and they never told this story with a light heart).

However, I remember one thing. A church, and I remember one person there: P.

P was my brother's best friend at the time. He had a history of coming on to random people but never anything too serious. He would always come around with my brother, my parents filled in a couple gaps including one where I spoiled a movie for him on accident.

P was in this church, and I was in the kitchen. I walked around the table, I saw him, and then my memory cut to a bouncy castle outside, but I can't remember anyone else. He was wearing a red shirt and khaki shorts, it was summer, and I had gone in with a crocodile ZooPals plate to get some grapes while everyone else was still outside.

About the time my memory stopped being a worthless POS, he stopped coming around. I later figured out that he tried to come onto my brother, and when my brother declined he started attacking him.

I tried to force myself to remember something about the church, but when I tried to remember past walking up to him in the kitchen, the details got extremely weird, like it was a mixture between what actually happened and a placeholder, like when you write over a deleted image and the recovered image is messed up to an extreme degree. This cause a panic attack the likes of which I hadn't felt before, and I tried to kill myself over it (obviously failed, thank god).

I'm not saying I have PTSD, nor am I asking if I do, it just sounds a lot like PTSD and I didn't know where else to post this. Its been weighing extremely heavy on me and I just needed to get it out."
2,"Lost my job, PTSD got me a bit lost For the first time I am starting to see that I have been living in a vicious circle for years. Every time I start enthusiastically and super driven to a new job, or a new project, or a new adventure, only to find out that I am passing by myself. My body hurts every day and the muscle tension worsens as I try to keep a job. What happens then is that I have to report sick at work, then sit at home for weeks because, among other things, my muscles can not get better quickly enough, then go back to work enthusiastically, and then get sick again.    


This happened to me again in recent months. I was offered a fantastic job and I started full of good sense. But then I became ill. I could no longer move my arms due to the muscle tension. I became uncertain about my own abilities. I was ashamed of myself to my employer and colleagues and hardly dared to go back to work. When I got better again, I had to report sick again after the second working day. And now I am at home without work. It is so hard to admit that I can not do this now. I have tried everytime. But it is impossible to keep up.   


I have been sexually abused on several occasions and I never realized the damaged it caused. I have incurred debts and I am unable to repay them. I can't sleep without having either sleep paralysis or nightmares forcing the terror to my conscious mind. My thoughts keep racing. My body hurts. I feel empty, depressed and it is difficult to enjoy the things I used to love so much.   


I can not afford to stop working, because I have to pay off, and because the fixed costs continue to exist. So how can I focus on my recovery if the worries about money keep following me? And how do I get to fully recover if I start working again? I am lost!  


So back to now. I don't have a job, and I lost interest in nearly everything I used to do. What do you guys do to keep up with day-to-day life? How do you manage to keep a clear head? I have so many questions but I don't really know how to put them into the right words so... anything helpful is welcome.   


Thanks in advance guys "
2,"Does it get better I’m trying so hard. I wake up and start meditating, seeking help, therapy, I try to process the past, I read self help books, philosophy, watch videos, and I even started going to a Buddhist temple. All the concepts make sense, but I still feel bad. It’s as if they make sense logically but nothing has clicked. I haven’t had any aha! moment.

I feel like there’s no way out, there isn’t any light at the end of the tunnel. It’s just an upward battle forever and then you die.  Is this it??? I don’t feel like I deserve to live. "
2,"I feel like I'm stuck in a glass prison. I'm completely new to this sub so I'm sorry if this post doesn't really belong here. I just feel so lost and alone. I finally have the person of my dreams in my life and he's so supportive and understanding, but I still feel like I can't tell him when I'm getting flashbacks or when I'm anxious or depressed because I don't want him to worry more than he does already and I'm still scared that he (or anyone) will find a way to take advantage of me. I feel like my entire life is made of glass and one wrong move will make the whole thing shatter. I'm sorry this post is kind of pointless I just had to get this thought off my chest."
2,Does Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) really work and is it possible for me to perform the technique? Hello and thank you in advance for reading. My girlfriend has PTSD from multiple sexual encounters with an abusive ex along with other encounters that I’d rather not get into. I read online about EDMR and I was wondering if it’d be able to help her. We don’t have much money so seeing a therapist isn’t in our budget. I was hoping I’d be able to learn how to perform it in an effort to help her. If anyone has experience with it I would greatly appreciate your input. 
2,"Nervous system response... Its wild to me to observe my nervous system responding to stimuli while I have a smile on my face. I feel my heart pounding, my hands are shaking. Yet I'm scrolling through nail polish shades on Amazon like I was before he decided to text (harass) me. 
         I've tried explaining this response to people with and without PTSD, has anyone else experienced this? I had read about this kind of progress but hadn't consciously recognized it in myself. I think its awesome and sad simultaneously. Awesome that I can engage with him and it doesn't have to ruin my day. I don't have to tailspin and call my therapist. He doesn't have that level of fucking power over me anymore! Its exciting! But, it's also sad that he messed up the person he vowed to protect, to love and honor. That I may never *not* have a neurological response to him. 
         Going to take this small win. Hope you all can feel good about progress too! "
2,"Update: The detective said we ""didn't have enough evidence to pursue a criminal case"", but I'm pulling every string I have in lae enforcement to get them to look harder. (TW:rape) So, basically, I had a scheduled appointment to call my rapist last month.. And I bailed on it because I was too afraid. But, then I did do it with the help of my little setvice dog in training. Just for the detective to say that we didn't get enough evidence in the phone call to make an arrest. It felt like i got punched in the gut. I tried storming out and he stopped me and said that he would ""look at the medical exam again"", meanwhile I'm fucking awaiting my STD screening just in case since he didn't use a condom. I know two people have called his sergeant. He just hasn't gotten back to me. I have this fire in my chest about it and I won't let it die. Until I've done everything I can.

But, I am fucking exhausted. I feel defeated. I feel like I should have just pretended it didn't happen. That it was fine. Like every other time. I thought this time would be different.."
2,"Does this sound like ptsd? I grew up with someone who psychologically/verbally abused me till I was 15. She eventually learned to stop (after a lot of work). But, she still uses the same voice and facial expressions she used during the abuse. Every time she uses the tone or facial expressions, I go spiraling. I either cry, go outside and scream, break my own stuff, or even scratch and hit myself. "
2,"Just feeling low I feel so tired. Today I went to the Dr because I was having stubble of a UTI. I'm out of town for work and couldn't get in to see anyone until mid afternoon and I felt like absolute shit because my symptoms had been going on for a day already. 

My boyfriend of three months had what we thought was a UTI a week ago. They gave him antibiotics and it seemed to get better but the day after he stopped the course his symptoms came back. His prostate is fine. 

My thoughts went immediately to an STI like chlamydia or gonorrhea. He's had a vasectomy and we're monogamous so we have unprotected sex. I have not had unprotected sex since 2008 or so when I was married. I typically use condoms for birth control because I can't tolerate the pill. Anyway. I had a full STI panel completed when I met my new boyfriend and everything was negative. 

So here we are three months later and I'm thinking he's fucked someone else. I'm freaking out about it, especially because he's so jealous that I can't ever mention past relationships or he covers his ears and wigs out. But he can talk about all his past shit. 

Right now I'm fixated on this friend of his I met on New Year's Eve who was a total skank. She was drunk as shit (it was only 10pm when we got there) her boyfriend was drunk as shit, and she was kissing and hugging all over my boyfriend. It pissed me off. At one point, he asked her how her relationship with her bf was going and she said it wasn't going well. He reached over and pinched her ear and said something like ""don't be so silly"" and it felt weirdly intimate. Like he looked like he was going to kiss her. I said,""what are you doing?"" And he said ""I pinched her ear."" I said ""why?"" And he said ""because she's being silly."" After I interjected, she turned around and started talking to some other chick at another table. 

I tried to talk to her and she completely blew me off. So I just gave up. She did stop hugging on my bf after that though. She actually left the table. Probably to get more drinks. 

My bf told her that she ""went crazy"" after her divorce and basically fucked a bunch of guys. He said he was her wing man.  She's a 55+ year old groupie for local bands/open mics. I find that pretty pathetic. 

My bf kept saying that he didn't know what she saw in her current man, because he wasn't her type. I said ""well, when you're a 50+ year old open mic groupie, that's the type you get."" My bf denied ever sleeping with her. I think he's lying.

the next day I did address that I didn't like how she was hanging all over him and he said that she does that when he ""brings people around"" - I assume other women. I had a panic attack before I could get up enough gumption to address it.  Then he kind of blew it off and started saying that he hardly hangs out with her at all, which I think is BS, because he talked about her a lot when we first met and she texted him to go see a Kix concert (yeah. Kix. She peaked in 1980.) He said he met her because his son dated her daughter. He always emphasizes that they are friends. But she seemed super possessive of him in a sexual, flirty way. It was odd. 

Anyway, I'm fixated right now on the idea that he fucked her while we started dating and she gave him an STI and now I have it. 

I'm also perseverating on an odd remark a waitress made when he introduced me to her. It's a local hangout he frequents. I think he used to drink a lot proper to meeting me. He told her I was his girlfriend and she said,"" now I know why you didn't sit in my section."" She didn't laugh, and she looked pissed off. She gave me the once over and glared at me. I asked him about it and he was very vague and acting like he didn't understand what I was getting at. I explained and he got defensive. All I said was it was an odd remark and asked him what she meant by it. He never did explain. 

I'm really angry right now and I may have no reason to be angry at all. I've been having escapist fantasies about just moving to another state and not telling anyone, killing myself, and admitting myself to the hospital. I'm perseverating on past traumatic experiences and cycling through everything bad that's ever happened to me in my life. 

I miss the life I had from 2005-2007. I think those were the happiest times of my life so far. I had friends, was confident. I've been really suffering since 2010 onward. I had six suicide attempts from 2011-2013. My husband at the time actually left me for dead and a friend called in for a welfare check (I left a suffice note on facebook.) I also left a note on the dresser. When the people came to do the welfare check he told them I was sleeping and went up to check on me. He had to have seen the note. He just went downstairs and told the cops I was asleep. My friend called the cops again and voiced concerns. They actually came back, forced they're way past him and took me to the hospital. I regained conciousness when they were carrying need down the stairs and recall my husband crying and then telling him to get out of the way. 

When I woke up at the hospital, I woke up to my ex doing sternal rubs and trying to keep me awake. I had an NG tube. For some weird reason that I still don't understand his secretary was there. He was basically putting on this show of trying to save my life after he'd basically left me for dead. 

I am so tired of trusting people only to have them let me down. I am so tired of having pain in my chest and daily panic attacks. I wish I would just die and then this would be over. This is not a life.

I'm doing EMDR but it's not working. My Drs took me off Xanax and put me on Valium. He keeps trying to wean me off of it but I have panic attacks so bad I miss work. He treats me like I'm a drug-seeking addict. 

I hate my life so much.

This is just me venting. I'm not going to kill myself. I just don't know what to do and I am so tired. I could try and file for disability but every time I try to look at my claim stuff I end up reliving the abuse. 

Thanks for reading if you got this far. I hope I didn't trigger anyone. I might call the helpline just to talk to someone.

2,"I don't know if this actually happened to me or not. I need help understanding. &amp;#x200B;

2 months ago I was diagnosed with PTSD, for other reasons than what I am about to attempt to explain. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 5 I visited Pakistan for a month, mainly because my uncle was getting married. I lot of eventful things happened, but for some reason, this one memory stands out and I can remember it more clearly than the rest. It was at his wedding, and being the only American child there, I felt alone and bored. So I went outside of the gates of my Uncle's house (Which was where the wedding was taking place) and I remember a man who was driving a wooden cart which was being pulled by goats. He offered to let me ride on the cart for a little bit for fun, which I did, got off, and went back inside. My entire life, whenever I remember this, I just remember feeling very uneasy, distrustful of this random man. And the memory of it was something that would come in my head at least once a week ever since then. I am pretty sure he was there for some purpose for the wedding, but it was never established when I had met this man. 

&amp;#x200B;

About a year ago, something odd started to happen. One day, while I was remembering it, the way I thought of the memory changed. Instead of me simply riding on top of a goat pulled cart, it was me and this girl who was around my age riding on it together, and at some point I jumped off of the cart, sensing that something was up. And it ended with the man shooting the girl in the head, and then shooting at me as I ran away back into my uncle's house. 

&amp;#x200B;

This ""new version"" of that memory just popped in my head out of no where one day last year. And ever since, whenever I remember that memory, I can barely picture what the ""original"" memory was, and instead I picture the version that recently came.

&amp;#x200B;

 Some facts about Pakistan: Many children are kidnapped and forced to do things like beg on the streets, many children are sold into labour by their parents. In fact, that same trip to Pakistan I ran into this group of children who had their eyes cut out, finger(s) cut off, etc, clearly by whoever kidnapped them, and they were begging for money (Obviously for their kidnappers.)

&amp;#x200B;

So what if in reality I luckily escaped a kidnapping attempt, and my brain recreated a ""substitute"" memory in place of the other one? Or am I just being crazy?

2,"I believe I have PTSD flashback but do not remember any trauma? Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

So for the past 6-7 years I have had this vision when I close my eyes that usually pops up after smoking pot (smoking way too much like oil) or doing psychedelics. I have had this vision at least 30 times now for 1-10 minute at a time.

&amp;#x200B;

I started to believe there was something wrong with me. Like maybe it's the vision of the future or that there is something wrong with me spiritually.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I think it might just be a traumatic memory I have had but don't recall.

&amp;#x200B;

This vision feels very intrusive in front of my eyes. It is accompanied by a vision of a person with paperwork in his hands walking from my left to my front as well as another person coming from the right. The vision is accompanied by this extremely weird and extremely uncomfortable feeling. Sometime's it is much more intense and it feels like pure dread. Like the ""matrix just collapsed in on itself/corrupted and I am still stuck in it."" That's the best way I can explain that feeling. It's very scary.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this PTSD? I can sort of feel it sitting deep in my mind even when I am not having it."
2,PTSD or not? I have been diagnosed with PTSD from sexual abuse by two past boyfriends. I have flashbacks sometimes when being intimate with my new boyfriend. But it isn’t all of the time. Is this truly PTSD? I’ve read about PTSD on forums and medical websites but no one really specified about how often. 
2,"So much success! First of all, I’ve posted here a few times in this past year and the understanding and support that I received has been absolutely wonderful! I’ve been given advice on how to deal with ‘normal’ incidents, how to explain things so people understand and when I had a massive knock back in November posting on here helped me through.

When I started EMDR I was given a ‘trauma score’ (this is what I call it, I actually have no idea what it is officially called) of 65. I was told that the number for ‘normal levels’ was 32. Basically, I had a long way to go to get better. I couldn’t see any end to it, I couldn’t sleep, I was jumping badly at every little thing. 

I was desperate. I needed it to stop. I went to my GP and got antidepressants, something I’d said I would never ever do. Alongside the EMDR (which was awful during the sessions but actually seemed to work really well for me), they slowly started making me feel better.

A month ago I stopped taking my antidepressants and I felt good! My friends were thrilled for me and seeing how excited they were, I was excited too.

This week I went to my therapy session and I was told that my scores were good and that I am OFFICIALLY in recovery!!

I’m so happy, I cant stop smiling, and after my session I went out to my car and cried. I feel like my PTSD started to define me these past few years. When I accepted it I was constantly trying to explain myself to people, trying to ‘get it out there’ that it’s not just military, that any traumatic event can cause it and it weakened me.

I’m so grateful that I had the strength to take action to help myself. 

I’m so grateful that my friends stood by me and that they honestly tried to understand what I was going through. 

I’m so grateful to my family who had no clue how to react but showed me how proud they were of me in their own little ways.

I’m so grateful that my therapists were able to teach me techniques that worked.

And I’m so grateful to this community who helped me through really difficult times, even the times when I couldn’t face talking to my friends. Hopefully I won’t be posting as much anymore but I will be here, trying to help you through as well ❤️"
2,"I follow your advice and I’m about to loose him I posted about a guy I’m seeing. He has ptsd and because of it, he would get distante etc.
I got a lot of good advice. Some of you told me that I should support not enable bad behavior, so I had the talk. I said exactly that, he says “clearly I can give you what you expect, I’ll have to think about us....

I’m so sad. Any advice?"
2,"Help? New to the sub, so sorry if this isn’t the right place to talk about this. 

I have C-PTSD from an extremely abusive home life that includes sexual abuse, physical and mental abuse as well as extreme emotional neglect. Then when I started dating, I must have had a sign on my forehead that said to take advantage of me because I’ve been assaulted/raped numerous times. I was stalked so much by an ex that I had to take a RO out, and my therapist thinks it’s smarter for me to just not date right now. I’m a 30 year old female and in addition to ptsd I have anxiety, DID and depression. I had to go on disability about 5 months ago because mentally I was struggling at work and becoming chronically suicidal. 

I’m doing much better now that they’ve figured out meds to a degree, however my doctors have a stipulation for me returning to work. I struggle being in open places, the park, taking a walk, etc. these places don’t have quick exits or places to hide, what if I become so overwhelmed that I have a panic attack and am nowhere near my car or personal space to breathe? It’s like playing a game of hide and go seek and I don’t feel I can stray far from home base because I need that safety net. Any suggestions for how to cope? I need to be able to do this before they’ll allow me to return (they don’t want me backsliding if I go back to work too early). I need help figuring out the  hyper vigilance aspect and how to cope in open/unknown spaces. 

Any help or advice is appreciated. Thanks —"
2,"Does anyone have any tips on how to get through situations where you must be exposed to a trigger for prolonged amounts of time? So I was planning to do research with my academic advisor in the fall, but I have to take a specific class first (taught by him).  This class is first thing in the morning, two days a week.  Now, there is a girl in this class who suffers from Tourette Syndrome.  Her tics consist of very sudden, very loud, very shrill meowing sounds.  One of the stimuli associated with the trauma I experienced is loud, sudden noises.  To say that I was totally unprepared for what I was going to have to deal with in that class is an understatement.  I have worked very hard for years to control my visible/perceivable reactions to my triggers, and I am at the point where loud noises, usually just make me flinch or cringe or grit my teeth or squeeze my eyes shut.  I used to go straight into a full-fledged panic attack like the flip of a switch.  By the end of that class there was so much cortisol in my bloodstream and I felt so anxious and stressed that I had tears in my eyes by the end of class, just like the old days of being exposed to loud noises I'm not prepared for.  I have worked so hard to get past that, but at that moment, I felt like I was right back where I started.  

I know this girl cannot control her tics just as I cannot control my hypothalamus, amygdala, and HPA axis' responses to my triggers, and I get even more anxious because I don't want her (or anyone else) to feel hurt because of my reactions to her tics or report me to the dean of students for being rude or malicious toward an individual with a disability because that is not my intention at all.  I have no intention.  My brain does what it does, and I can't help it.  In other circumstances I would probably drop the class for another one, but I need to take this class if I want to do research in the fall.  I've already explained my situation to the professor, but that doesn't prevent me from being exposed to the trigger every few minutes, for 75 minutes straight, first thing in the morning, two days a week.  I don't want to take my xanax that often, but I also don't want my stress response to be triggered every four or five minutes while in class because it is obviously very physically and mentally taxing, and I'm concerned it might affect my ability to learn the class material.  Does anyone have any tips for how to calm myself down and get through this class?  

Again, I COMPLETELY understand that this girl cannot control her tics, that she has a disability, and that she is not doing anything of malice towards anyone, just as I have no malicious intentions involved with my reactions.  I have no issues with her.  I just need to get myself through this class, and that's my problem, not hers."
2,"Hypnosis therapy was effective Has anyone here tried hypnosis to assist with recovering from trauma? I did when I was 18 (currently 21) and barely remember even going to the sessions but have improved tremendously because of the sessions. I was repeatedly sexually abused as a child by a family member. My boyfriend at the times aunt ran a hypnosis therapy clinic in Chicago. She offered a few free sessions with a great hypnotist there which was extremely kind of her because there was no way I could afford that at the time. I wanted to forget every memory of being molested and abused and pretty much trick myself into having no memory of it so I did not have to actually recover from the trauma because this family member is someone I see frequently. My family is super Muslim so bringing up something like this in the open wouldn’t be appropriate and I would be somehow blamed for it even though I was around 4 years old when it started. Even just bringing up a very small part of my trauma once to my mom when I was 15 years old resulted in her saying that “we don’t talk about these things”. Police involvement, etc isn’t an option or something that I wish to pursue. 

After the first session, I was already starting to disassociate with the memories. By the 5-6 session I was completely forgetting and could make myself believe that it was a memory someone told me about but never actually happened to me. I started to even forget I sought out hypnosis a few months after. I have not even thought about this since but recently had a dream about the same hypnosis clinic. I make daily entries in an online journal so I was able to go back to entries made 3 years ago and read my daily experience and pretty much watch my progression with disassociating the memories. 

Just wanted to share my experience of hypnosis being extremely helpful and was wondering if anyone else has ever thought about seeking out help in this way? "
2,"Fuck this muscle tension and the flashbacks Heard a flag flapping in the wind and the snapping sound reminded me of gunfire and my muscles locked up - tension so taught the lactic acid made my body catch fire. My own personal highlights montage was already playing on the back of my eyes. It's weird the way the memories come back the night my sister was raped she texted for help but in the memories I hear her screaming in the dark and I can't find her. On the way home every car on the highway was about to crash into me. The urge to jump out of the moving vehicle and run into the forest beside the road was overwhelming.

I went for coffee with an ex girlfriend and knocked my coffee over because I just dont have the motor control anymore. She asked me if I knew my eye was twitching, I didn't. Yesterday (Today?) I don't know for sure but they started me on an SSRI and I had a freakout while home alone, and I couldn't find my anti-psychotics. Last time this happened I tried to hang myself - this time I put my fist through my bedroom door and then ripped it off it's hinges.

My muscles burn right now but I can't have muscle relaxants because they're ""AdDiCtiVe"" which I know deep down is true - but fuck me sideways my body is on fire and I'm ready to kill myself. I question taking a cocktail of random pills when valium 2mg not even the full strength one always did the job. My favorite part is that SSRI's have ""discontinuation syndrome"" which may include flu like symptoms and worsening of symptoms. While evil valium has ""withdrawal"" flu like symptoms but is totally not the same. Whatever doc just get me hooked on whatever will make this stop.

The best description I ever heard for ptsd was like having a glass and everytime something bad happens a little water is added - and when it's full well then you're fucked. 

Monty python is on tv and it just made me laugh: it is the scene in the Holy Grail where John Cleese storms a castle alone and stabs everyone men, women and children on his way up with glee he stops at one point turns around and slashes some roses on the wall - fucked up but I grinned. At this point my forearms are burning while typing from too much remembering so I'll leave it here.

Goodnight reddit.

2,"Life is a rollercoaster I'm constantly going from med to med, counseling from one facility to another. My dreams are always nightmares and I find myself so easily disappointed.

I'm about to quit my job because of all the gossip in the clinic, this sucks because everyone I talk to just says that it's a really normal aspect in a clinic. 

I have too much integrity to just sit and hear the gossip so I've gone to management about it many times and have asked people not to talk to me.

Whenever I have a really bad ptsd attack is always after I find myself being disappointed in myself or the good of others. Like the pollution on the planet, people not being as nice to me as I am to them, friends flaking on me, the delusional ways in which people live.

I always tend to get so overwhelmed about these things and it results in full blown panic, paranoia and hallucinations.

As a child I was sexually abused by family members I had trusted and for a very long time I just thought that I had been doing something wrong. Like I wasn't behaving well enough and it was some form of punishment. Before this is was always so lighthearted and playful and wanted to make friends.

When this started happening I became isolated and I started to hate everyone. I was only 5.

I still suffer from triggers from that moment.

When I was 20 I began a mentally and emotionally abusive relationship. It started ok and just went down hill. He always accused me of being overly friendly and he killed my dog out of negligence.

I always tried to do the best I could but constantly always told myself there must be something wrong with me.

I am now at a point where I am trying to seek help and not be in an environment that is detrimental to my health like my current workplace.

I just don't feel a lot of hope right now. I've been living with this for so long, I don't know if I'll ever not have ptsd."
2,"Triggers I've been diagnosed with ptsd about a year ago and it's been really difficult for me to acknowledge the fact. Tonight I saw blood relatives who came into my work. I didn't want them knowing where I worked because I was afraid they might tell my abuser and he'd start harassing me like he did my sister. I told my manager and I kept to the back until they left. My coworkers were so sweet and empathized with me. 

The whole time they were in the restaurant I was breaking down. My legs kept giving out. Fear, flashbacks, and anger filled my mind. I was nauseated and dizzy. 

I felt so embarrassed for my behavior at work. I've been doing so well to keep my troubles away from work that I couldn't help but feel disappointed in myself. 

Recently I've been coming to face the facts that I have ptsd and I should stop ignoring it. Not taking it seriously has only made it worse. I've been scrolling through this sub for a while now and I wanted to share because I feel so alone. This community is a blessing and even just telling random people on the internet about tonight helps. 

Thanks for reading. Tonight showed me that I have a lot of work to do. "

2,Is this a sign of PTSD? Just watched scene in a show which contained a car crash. When and up to the collision happening I felt this primal sense of fear then started hyperventilating and a migraine was triggered?

2,"PTSD episode on Dr. Phil So, recently theres this episode where he gives this woman with severe PTSD a chance at new experimental treatment.

I'm not sure what exactly he means, but he says hes connected to the leading PTSD researcher in the world who apparently said talk therapy isnt that effective and they think rewiring the brain is better. I wouldn't be surprised if this is true.

I'm just curious if anyone knows who exactly hes talking about? The discussion on the show was about finding a new way to cope because conventional therapy wasn't helping, he mentioned he would hook her up to the research.

Does that mean there are scientists trying to create a new form of treatment? I'm curious how much it would help. I'm not sure if something like that exists already, or something that purely and effectively helps rewire. I'm kind of wondering if they're doing trial runs or cases to test this out. "
2,"Did anyone else with PTSD who watched James' McAvoy's film ""Split"" find it weirdly inspirational? I realize this might seems like a strange question. James McAvoy's character was obviously very fucked in the head. But there were parts of the story that I found strangely uplifting for anyone with a history of trauma. The idea that someone who went through horrendous trauma could basically modify their epigentic profile on such a radical level to create something like ""the beast"" based on pure belief about who they were...is pretty incredible. Also, the idea that he not only let the girl go with a history of self-injury and being molested, but basically called her the next step in human evolution/gave her this sense of power she'd never had before...was something to watch. Most of the time perpetrators prey on who they think are easy targets, people with a past history of trauma...and this was a complete reversal of that. There have been plenty of times when I didn't say a word about anything in my past, any trauma, but felt like assholes/psychos/creeps could smell it on me...maybe reading into some kind of body language or vibe I was giving off..and my instincts were always right on the money. I pick up on A, B, and C, quicker and quicker now and I don't give them the time of day, but still it seems like a never ending cycle of my version of swatting. For once it would be nice to not feel like a target or this unidentifiable ""other"" that the wrong people seem to see. "
2,"I'm having bad episodes, and I am not sure why or if it is even ptsd related. May be sensitive topic or trigger for someone,not sure.  Not even sure if this is a good spot to post this. 

I am in the works of looking for a therapist to find answers, but that has been an impossible quest. Anyway, I have been diagnosed with ptsd about 2 years ago but had been living with it for a long while. 

I try to explain this to my significant other, and I think my so doesn't understand. Seems to think I am just not able to control my emotions

Out of nowhere I get this feeling like my brain is being cheese graeted and I flip out. I spend 20 minutes screaming about how terrible this world is and how much I am tired of existing because of how screwed up living is. How no one gives cares about me (obviously not true since I am in a relationship) and I am tired of everyone and this world taking a dump on me. I'm not in the drivers seat when this happens... It just comes out in this long winded angry rant.  It is starting to strain my relationship. I have zero interest in hurting myself or anything. On the daily I try to find positive things about my life and these episodes just keep happening regardless of the positivity I add to  my days, and I have no idea why. 


I was diagnosed with ptsd 2 years ago but had it since I was much younger. These episodes are a whole new animal to me and I am trying to figure this out. 

Tldr: episodes causing concern. Any idea what it is?

2,"I am of value. My value is not something I have to earn. 
I am not a burden.
I am loved.
And today comes tears after these words. Because I’m starting to believe them.

2,Do they actually care? Feels like the people I live with don't care. They say that they're here for me and stuff like that. But when I start to have anxiety it's like they turn a cold shoulder to me and avoid to make convo even when I try to start later after my anxiety cools down. Btw these people aren't my parents but somebody else's.
