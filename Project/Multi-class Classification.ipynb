I honestly feel like I've lived a cursed life. In November I experienced yet another extremely traumatic event. I've been in therapy a long time and had made so much progress. There were days I was actually happy and not a mess. Then the event happened and it's like everything I worked for was gone. I'm worse than I ever have been. I started seeing a trauma therapist but I just don't feel like I can handle it. It feels like the trauma is ongoing and won't end for a long time because of hearings and court dates and the thing I dread the most, a trial. I'm at the point I don't even want justice, but everyone around me is pushing me along saying I have to do it to protect any future victims. I've been such a mess I have almost been hospitalized multiple times for suicidal ideation. I a lot of times feel like I wish my attacker had succeeded so I didn't have to go through all this. Do I have to start all over from the beginning? I know I need to quit using heroin and other opiates but if I don't I feel like I can't stand to exist.\n",
