0,"Meditation is making me anxious I do a couple sessions a day on headspace. Just opening the app gets my heart racing. The silence, I can’t run from my worries or drown them out. It’s torture. Just me and my mind. How long until it gets easier? I’m about two days in right now and it’s my most dreaded part of the day."
0,"Rant about anxiety meds - I've been self medicating with Benzodiazepines (Valium) First it started with cannabis, a very no nonsense substance at face value but ultimately terrible as an anxiety medication (currently). You simply can't dose this stuff appropriately, too much causes the exact symptoms your trying to treat and so does tolerance buildup.

Queue Valium, decided to self medicate trying for once a week. Now it's twice a week. Now it's three times a week. Fuck.

Time to take a break, take some time off and do some research, something isn't right about benzodiazepines and I need to know what... (nah it's just me with my messed up coping skills)

Take any amount of time looking at the benzo withdrawals list and it's sure to leave a sour taste, that shit is no joke. No other withdrawals are as deadly (other than alcohol)

The system that these drugs work on in your body is the last thing someone with anxiety should be messing with, the only way to take these things therapeutically is short term, which our condition isn't short term... is it? 

Such an incredibly important and fragile system needs respect (GABA) and as soon as you throw that out of whack you've immediately doubled or tripled the amount of anxiety you could have been experiencing, unless you keep on the pill... eventually needing more of the same.

This makes me question, are the benzos worth it? I'm thinking fucking nah they're not!

These things are more abhorrent than opiates in my mind and I'm sorry for anyone who's been forced onto big dosages to battle anxiety, I believe you've been lead astray.

I'm mostly writing this in attempt to convince myself to flush the rest of the fuckers down the toilet, I'm not interested in losing months of my life tapering if I can cut it off now.

My only saving grace has been BETA BLOCKERS, I don't think there's anything better and safer than that in conjunction with therapy.

This has all been just my biased opinion. Take it as you will. "
0,"Some advice for my friend please? I dated this girl for about a year, before she moved away temporarily for a service opportunity. She’s been gone a few months now, about a year left on the trip, and we’ve been communicating via email. She just confided in me that she’s been having some fairly serious anxiety problems.

She told me “I’ve been having a lot of anxiety, to the point where I just can’t really function or do normal work, like we just have to stay inside for hours until I can breathe again”.

Do any of you have advice for her? Or advice for ways I could help her? I feel like I’m out of my depth here. I’ve had my own bouts of depression (a side effect of my ADHD), but for me that mostly manifested as just “going through the motions” of life, going to school/work, hanging out with friends/family, but never really feeling anything, constantly afraid that somebody would notice what a failure I was.

I’m planning to suggest that she try to write down exactly what makes her anxious, and try to figure out WHY that gets to her. Sometimes that helped me, mostly so I realize that what I’m afraid of is actually not that bad. Other times, though, it has been...  counter productive.

Anyway, what would you tell her? What advice have people given that helped you?"
0,"Feeling like I’m back to where I started. I’ve been feeling a lot better even since beginning 50mg sertraline in early November. My social anxiety has been almost non-existent, lessened general anxiety, and rarely a depressed mood.

I was triggered recently by someone who popped back into my life. Today I experienced paranoia that everyone didn’t like me at work, I kept stumbling over my words, and I was hyper aware of all my actions. 

I have a checkup in March, and if this persists, I’ll bring it up to my PCP. I also want to make an appointment to begin therapy as soon as I get some extra money. I may also express to her concerns that I possibly have borderline personality disorder.. which isn’t on a whim (there are many reasons why I believe so, only recently understood all of the symptoms clearly). 

I think I just need to vent. I was so happy that I thought I was over this shit. I feel like I’ve been catapulted back to square 1."

I have great weeks/months and then anxiety comes back.  Ive learned how to deal/manage anxiety better by reading DARE, which really helped but its not a cure all.  I hate taking medication to the point where thinking about taking a medication gives me anxiety.   I take a BP medication but my suspicion is that my BP is typically high from anxiety.  When Im anxious my BP gets up to 170/90 and that makes me fear for my heart since my fathers side has a history of stuff.  Anyone in the same boat?  "
0,"bad intrusive thoughts that aren't like me at all I've been suffering from waves of anxiety and depression for roughly 4-5 years now. Some times are better than others and I have managed to conquer my daemons on more than one occasion, but these thoughts always come back when I'm stressed or unhappy in some way. Recently I've been having a nice time and I'll get bad intrusive thoughts in my head, some really awful nasty things (that I'd never mean/do or say!) and it's really getting to me. 

I'm a worrier, I always have been, so I think this is what fuels these thoughts. A bit like, you're scared to say something because you're afraid it might happen. E.g. like when people don't talk about illness because they're afraid if they do, it might happen, etc.. and other bad things of this nature. 

Has anybody had any experience with these kinds of bad intrusive thoughts and if you have, how have you managed to get over it?

Thanks"
0,"I’m either overwhelmed or left out I’ve been going through a really tough couple of months and I decided to take time for myself and be distant from friends because the way I see it, I can either devote what little energy I have to school and studying or to social interactions, and I wore myself out trying to function like I usually do. 

So far, keeping to myself has been great. My anxiety’s calmed down so much and I’ve been able to care for myself more. The problem is that being distant and seeing friends bond without me makes me feel left out, which only makes me anxious again. I’ve told my best friend I need to be alone for a while and she’s been understanding, but seeing the rest of the group make plans without me makes me feel like I’m being purposefully excluded. 

I understand these worries are completely unfounded and while I’ve shared some of these worries with my friend before, I know not everybody has my crazy person brain and she doesn’t mean to make me feel bad. Still, I can’t help but feel hurt in a way. It’s a catch 22; being with them makes me anxious, not being with them makes me anxious. 

Does anyone ever experience the same thing or have any tips on dealing with it?"
0,"How can i help someone i am not very close to with their anxiety? So I am moving in with my girlfriend and her family in a week. 
It is her, her mom, and her sister. My girlfriend and her mom work most days, all day. And her sister stays at home and does her thing.

While I am looking for a job, I will be with her sister a lot. She has pretty bad anxiety, mostly I believe agoraphobia. 
Last time I was there we didn't talk much. My gf told me she just likes the company so I didn't really try to initiate conversation but later learned her sister was a little upset we just sat there! Dumb anxiety haha. 

I would love to take her on walks or something. I dont know how much we will click but I would like to help her get out more. I don't want to be pushy though. And since we are still kind of strangers, it might be hard at first. I don't know how receptive she is to advice, new people, facing anxiety, etc.

0,"I hate when people call me. Whenever my phone rings I feel my stomach flip because I’m sure someone is calling me to tell me someone is dead. I’ve told people to text instead, and two people who can’t fucking get this is my mother and my mother in law. 

What’s worse is that they call over stupid shit that could have easily been sent by text. My mom will call and leave a voicemail where she just says “call me.” And when I call her? It’s stupid shit. 

I’ve started not answering my phone ever and if someone doesn’t leave a voicemail or the voicemail is something insubstantial, I ignore it. 

They know it gives me anxiety. I explained to everyone why I’d rather them text. However, these two either don’t care or really think their trivial calls are important."
0,"Strange symptom of anxiety? Since my breakdown 6 months ago and my subsequent anxiety/panic, I’ve become hyper aware of my mental sensations and thoughts, to a distressing extent. 

 For example, if I’m having dinner with family I dissociate but become incredibly sensitive to what’s going on around me - I can see everything, hear the knives and forks and the chewing, and notice subtle things which would otherwise go unnoticed.

In summary, since my breakdown I ha e become incredibly sensitive to everything and notice everything so much more, which induces a lot of anxiety and concern about my mental health.

Any ideas?? "

0,"to coffee or not to coffee? I read that coffee is bad to anxiety, and I'm really a bit addicted. I think that if I stopped in two weeks I would control my addiction. But coffee is something that I like, isn't the addiction. So I think I would lose some part of my fun if I stop. 

Is possible to drink less, but is this possible? I think that if I try to drink less I would be anxious because of the caffeine addiction. What do you think? "
0,"Who else is taking hydroxyzine for anxiety? I’ve been on Zoloft for 11 years but never taken anything for the anxiety/panic attacks. It got bad over the last few weeks and I went to talk to a doctor because I couldn’t even function, if I left bed I paced back and forth until I ended up in bed again. Dr thinks it happens at this time of year because I had to go through my dog having cancer and passing away around this time a few years ago. Ever since, it’s always something this time of year. 

Anyway she gave me hydroxyzine and I’m not sure of its effectiveness. It knocks me out and helps me stay asleep, but I usually wake up with my mind racing the next day as usual. The dreams are weird too, last night I was fighting aliens that wouldn’t let me leave the car wash. 

I go back on the 19th for a follow up, should I ask for something else?"
0,"Social media induced anxiety I'm currently sitting here, heart pounding, hands sweaty, all because of Instagram.
I took a break of a few days right after Christmas, for no real reason just because I wanted to. I downloaded the app again today.
I scrolled through it a few times, then a few times more. Then suddenly the familiar feeling of anxiety started creeping up my throat. 
I then deleted the app. Now I'm tripping myself out because I pride myself on being at least somewhat put together.
The fact that I can no longer look at this stupid app, and that it has so much control over my emotions, makes me feel weak minded and helpless. 
I've battled homelessness, moved across the country by myself, so this small blip is seriously just that, tiny and insignificant. So then why can't I be happy for my friends instead of looking at their pics and overthinking them? I think they call it FOMO (fear of missing out) and admitting that I feel that makes me so horribly angry. And yet, when I tell my fam and friends how it makes me feel, they don't understand and think its a bit odd that something as simple as an app can have such a profound negative effect on me. (It's just an app you know!)
If its just an app, then why tf are you all questioning why i'm not on it instead of trying to comfort me? You know what I mean?
I just feel like there's no way they aren't at least somewhat affected by all this stimulus, and I feel alone af with my thoughts, once again. akfaksasg I don't mind not using the app because obviously it hinders my mental health. I just don't want to feel alone right now. I don't want to feel like everyone really is just mentally dying inside and just settling for that, because thats just ""life nowadays."" I refuse to believe that I have to be a part of social media to be included in society. But it sure fucking feels that way. "
0,"looking for Advice for quitting Escitalopram (or similiar) after long time use Hello, good people.

I'm looking for some advice/personal experience as I'm trying to quit using Escitalopram. I have taken them for around 5 years, and for the last year or so I have gradually gone from using 15mg to 5mg.

0,"NYE-Party gone wrong, please help me... Hi,

So I'm a 16 year old dude living in Sweden. I'm social and outgoing, people would probably describe me as an extrovert. Yet I'm extremely anxious over even the smallest things.

Well, I was invited to a party this New Year's Eve and it was also the first time drinking alcohol. So I knew 3 people there, and we were 2 guys and 6 girls. I drink 1 beer and 1 cider before going to get a small buzz, getting in the mood making social situations easier you know...

Well we get there and it's awkward from the start since I mistake the host with the host's mom. It goes ok and then we meet and greet and I start fucking downing alcohol like an addict. I drank almost all my cider instantly (atleast 3 in a row) and then a couple glasses of champagne and then some more cider. 

As you'd probably guess it goes black from there. We were supposed to be picked up at 3 but due to my drunken behavior my friends parents came and picked us up at 10, 2 hours into the party...I Had made people uncomfortable since I was so drunk, stumbling around and passing out here and there. 

It was going so great in the beginning and everything was so fun. Finally I had been invited to a party you know? I was living out my teenage years like I've always wanted to! Yet I fuck it up. I cried for like an hour while the people I knew tried to take care of me. I begged one of them to shoot me (I'm not a suicidal person...) and was behaving like a maniac. 

I've seen some videos from the night. I confessed my love for the host, I took my shirt off and was too drunk to put it back on and tried to escape the house. I have bruises everywhere. So much happened that I'm embarrassed over and I feel so ""tired"", I don't know how to explain it.

The worst thing is that I barely knew what I did wrong. I started talking loudly that's the only thing I know they told me. Fuck, I've screwed up badly and don't know how to handle the situation...

I wanted 2018 to be my year but how the fuck is that supposed to work out if I can't behave like a normal fucking individual. How should i cope with this?"

0,"How to deal with Existential Anxiety? Any advice on how to overcome it? :)

I am struggling a lot with deciding what to do with my life. I have tried to define a purpose for myself but I haven't been successful so far. I realized I am unlikely to come up with a single purpose which would motivate me to get out of bed and feel passionate about something. I think trying to come up with a purpose for myself is too difficult for my brain to achieve. The amount of things I can do with my life is astronomical, and I can't seem to like something enough to make me want to do it. 

(Don't worry I am still a productive human being, but I tend to treat my work as distractions and a necessity rather than feeling passionate about it.)

So without a purpose to guide my day to day decisions on how to spend my time, the question I often ask myself when I am alone and not getting distracted by anything is ""What should I do right now or the next moment?"" And I am constantly trying to reassure myself to not panic and feel anxious when I can't think of anything. It is perfectly normal to not do something and just be still. Trying to ignore thoughts like ""If I don't have a purpose, then why am I still here?""

I wasn't always like this. Since I had a breakdown due to existential crisis, I can't be who i was before.

I would really appreciate it if people can provide some advice or maybe reaching out to me to talk about it :)"

The vacation ended up being great: very peaceful, lots of mental space. I feel so much healthier.

I have to return to work tomorrow. It's a remote gig. I don't feel invested in it at all, and it's full of gross techie types who have no regard for other people's feelings or experiences. (I'm a techie myself.) It pays the bills, but at the end of every day, I feel wiped out and like I just lost another day of my existence to something completely meaningless.

I'm dreading tomorrow. I know I should be looking for other jobs, or maybe even other types of jobs. I need to figure out a more sustainable work arrangement in 2018 or I'm going to lose my mind. But it's a scary job market out there, even for tech people, believe it or not."
0,How to not sound unhinged when you speak? It's come to my attention recently that when I speak my neuroticism shows in my voice. People have always kind of had a put off reaction to me speaking which imagine is due to that unhinged quality of it and I've probably been in a feedback loop for years where I speak kind of shaky because I'm nervous people will have a negative reaction to it and then it shows and they have a negative uncomfortable reaction to it. Advice on how to speak and sound more normal would be much appreciated.

0,"I'm extremely scared. What do I do? I'm really frightened and I don't know what to do with myself.

Every flicker of light, every movement, every sound. They cause me to panic. I feel as though someone or someTHING is out to get me.

Maybe I'll be driving and get hit by a car, then get stabbed while we exchange license and insurance information. Or maybe my house will get broken into and I'll get shot.

Something bad is going to happen, but I don't know what or why. I'll only know those answers once it happens. It's just my gut feeling. I'm predicting the future. These are premonitions.

0,"i'm 22 tomorrow and i'm struggling This will probably be quite a long post but I want to vent my feelings. 

Tomorrow is my 22nd birthday. 2017 was a really rough year for me; I graduated and moved back to my parents in a town with nobody else in it, I lost a lot of friends, I broke up with my girlfriend of two years, I started developing feelings for my friends ex-girlfriend, who’s sort of shown an interest back but has now decided that it’s not a mutual thing, and I’m working a part time job in a badly run café where things get really stressful. 

I’ve always been a worrisome person, but in the last six months or so my anxiety has gotten very bad. I can’t sit still easily, or be alone, I’m always reaching for my phone to find somebody to talk to. I am always stressed out about my future, about finding a real graduate job, finding the money to move out, and now I’m single all of these fears of never meeting somebody have come to my system. I really struggle to approve of my appearance and I dread photos at anything I go to. 

I had a birthday event a few days ago and I got way too drunk, started crying and talking about being depressed. I don’t know if I actually am or not, but I struggle to find true feelings of lightness throughout most of my day. I am always feeling heavy, always on the edge, always a little unhappy. I constantly worry about being shy, awkward, saying the wrong thing.

When it turned midnight for 2018 all I was filled with was dread. I went into the bathroom, locked it, slid to the floor and just started crying. I’ve felt as though all of the secure parts of my life are unravelling a little, and while I know that my situation certainly isn’t the worst in the world, I have never felt lonelier, more isolated or low self-esteem wise. 

I can’t remember what it was like to not be anxious, to not feel dread and that something is about to fall apart. I hope to find a way to live with all of these thoughts and get back to a more positive head space, I just don’t really know how to go about it. I’m sorry for such a long post but I wanted to express myself and just vent. 

Thank you so much for reading if you made it this far.

0,"Anyone feel like you can't talk to doctors/therapists/counsellors about your existential thoughts? Hi guys, I don't know about you, but I am currently struggling with getting help with my existential thoughts. I have always been embarrassed about talking to doctors about them, and anxious in the fear that THEY might begin questioning reality too. When I told a doctor once, and he was a young doctor, but I still thought he would know, they just asked ""Existential? what does that mean?"" I was thinking ""Are you serious...""

That experience just reinforced my view that I shouldn't tell anyone who could possibly help me, in case they don't know/freak out/can't understand it/are not equipped mentally do deal with such questions. I know doctors are intelligent and well trained, but that doesn't mean that they have questioned life before. It's like I worry that the thoughts are contagious. It's reassuring to know that others get this, but I do personally hate reading about people's *specific* thoughts that they get, because I am prone to worrying about those thoughts too, after I have been exposed to them. Hence worrying about the mental health of doctors/therapists, once I share.

So has anyone here spoken about existential thoughts to them? Do you think that I should? Thanks."

Ive been checked out over the last 25 years and so far so good, so its just the manifestation of my anxiety disorder as a damned physical symptom. My arms and legs get pains all the time too that make me think im stroking out, which exacerbates the damn anxiety.

0,"Really worried about being alone. Hello all. I’m a college freshman home for winter break. I’m feeling really alone. My old friend group from high school kinda grew away from me as I went to a different high school, so I’ve been seeing plenty of snaps and Facebook posts about them hanging out together and being really close but have never been invited or even reached out to. I was really close to church friends through my junior year but I basically vanished my senior year because my dad left my family, I had to work, and I had to get myself a scholarship to college (which I did). They’re all like a big family, and while they include me in stuff, I cannot escape the feeling that I’m just a guest there, not a member of that family. 
I did get a full ride to William and Mary (I’m from Florida), which meant I go to school out of state, while most of them going to state schools. Most of them still see each other all the time and are super close, while I’ve had to start over. It kinda hurts to see my college friends hanging out with their friends from home and still being super close to them while I don’t really have that luxury.
There is one guy who I think I’ll be friends with the rest of my life. He was my best buddy in high school and we’re still really close. And my girlfriend, who goes to school in DC, is home too so I can see her. I’m grateful for them but wish I had a bigger friend group from home that I was still close to.
I’ve loved college, but haven’t really found a new best friend yet. I’ve still kinda struggled with feeling like an outsider and not really fitting in. I have plenty of surface friends, but I want a close, supportive friend group more than anything in the world, and I hope it’s not too late. Is it?
Can anyone relate to this? Is it weird to not be close with people from high school? How can I get rid of these feelings of loneliness and feeling like I’m a failure? How can I find what I’m looking for in college?"
0,"My boyfriend broke up with me because of my anxiety Ive been struggling with separation anxiety since I was young and it ultimately ended up ending my relationship. A few months back I had a really bad panic attack and my boyfriend made it very clear that if my anxiety didn't ease up, he'd leave me. 

Since what I was scared of was loosing him because he's been the only person in my life I've had a secure attachment to, I tried really hard to just not be anxious around him. But that ended up making me feel like I was bursting at the seams with my anxiety and anxiety would either leak out in small ways, like me being clingy and scared when he'd leave me, or I'd just explode and have big panic attacks. He'd make me feel ashamed when I panicked or felt anxious by getting annoyed, but I don't think it was intentional. He really just didn't know what to do or how to handle it. And outside of all the anxiety, our relationship was still pretty damn solid. We still were very compatible, got along great, and had an amazing time when I wasn’t anxious.

Ultimately, I felt like he put me in a position where it was completely on me to change my anxiety without him changing how he reacted to it. I tried to express that to him after we broke up, but he didn't want to hear it. Instead he left me feeling like it was my fault for having anxiety in the first place. I've just been left in a place where I feel abandoned and like I was justified in having separation anxiety in our relationship. I don’t know how to get over the breakup at this point and let him go."

0,"Subconsciously sucking in my stomach? I don't know if this is the correct sub to post and ask this, but I recently noticed that I always have my stomach sucked in.

Maybe its become a habit because I want to appear thinner, or because I don't want to make a lot of noise when I breathe because I don't have the confidence to breathe full breaths of air. But I think its even making my voice soft, unable to project and be loud. 

Anyone else have similar experiences?"
0,"Is my anxiety really anxiety? I wonder if there's anybody else under the impression that their anxiety issues are caused by something more physical. Like in my case I kind of feels like my anxiety derives from digestive issues and not the other way around. Maybe gas build up. For example, I might start getting a feeling of pressure in my chest and start getting my anxiety attack and then I burp and then the feeling goes away temporarily. 

Am I crazy to think about that. I recently did another experiment and I stopped drinking coffee for about two days. I am not a heavy coffee drinker, I always have a morning cup and that's it. However, while I did not drink coffee my anxiety was pretty much non-existent. Today I had my morning coffee and boom, I've been getting anxiety attacks all day.

I believe this idea is something worth exploring."

0,"SSRI Symptoms Hi everyone,

I've been lurking for a few weeks and I'm finally able to get up the courage to ask a question.  

My anxiety started in June when my brother passed away.  I stuffed all of my grief into a box and went right back to work.  Almost predictably, my work performance suffered behaviorally. After getting a terrible (the worst in my career) review, I started having panic/anxiety attacks.  I sought out therapy right away, but I wasn't getting better quickly enough for my boss.  

This gets to my question: I went to my GP and got on Zoloft and Xanax.  The Zoloft did pretty well to even me out once I found the right dosage, but the side effects were extreme.  After taking the Zoloft, I would immediately dry heave, followed by tremors down my sides, then I would get really ""weepy"".  Google said to stop taking and call my Doctor, which I did.

My Doc told me to stop taking the Zoloft (after only being on it for a week) and call him back if I still needed an anti-depressant.  I was pretty even for a little bit until I got an email from my boss while on vacation.  So - here we go again, back on an SSRI, but it's Lexipro this time.  I'm only on 5 mg, but after a little over a week, I see some of the same symptoms coming back (tremors and weepy-ness). 

Does anyone else have these symptoms? Is this normal? After speaking with a couple of other friends, none of them report any side effects at all.

TL:DR  I get weepy and tremors when taking SSRI's, is that normal? "
0,"The past 4 or 5 times I've been to the guitar store I've had to leave because of anxiety attacks. So I've been playing guitar for a year now and it's helped me in general so much. I'll always look forward to going to guitar center or some place like that because it's fun to try out new guitars and new gear and it's usually helpful for me to be able to try something before I go get it. The trouble is that usually when I get there my mind completely shuts down regarding what I should play and the longer I'm in there the more the panic sets in. It has nothing to do with being afraid of playing in front of people because I play in front of people pretty often with no nerves at all and the most I've played in front of was probably 300-400 people at a Christmas Eve service. I've even gotten compliments before and had a guy next to me at Guitar Center start jamming along with me.

So I don't know why I freeze and can't think of what to play to try something out even if I'd just practiced something beforehand and I don't know why it's become such a stressful experience going somewhere I enjoy. I usually buy online but I'm looking to buy a bass guitar or a new electric and those things you need to feel and try before you buy it so I have to go in there. Anyone have any tips at all?"

0,"Natural/herbal remedies to help driving test stress Hi everyone, I’ve got a bit of a problem and figured you guys would be the bests ones to help.

Essentially I keep failing my driving test due to anxiety, I get so stressed I can’t concentrate and panic, making silly mistakes. My instructor says I don’t need any more lessons as I can drive, just not under test conditions.

Does anyone have any recommendations of things I could take before hand? (Non prescription) I’ve taken amiltryptaline in the past which has helped me calm down but it makes me too drowsy to be able to drive safely.

Thank you for any tips too, I’m open to anything as this is getting to be an expensive problem! "
0,"Happening now: Heart palpitations from nowhere ...And I'm scared. They started around 6 last night after I had a frozen drink (and I finally realized that's one of my triggers), and while it's calmed down, my heart keeps pounding. My wife swears my heart beat sounds normal. I managed to sleep for three hours, but I'm really scared right now. I feel this sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach, and when I stand up I feel light-headed.

Not sure if anyone is able to respond, but I'd appreciate any kind words. This *has* happened before and I should know I will survive, but I am freaked the fuck out right now. Every sensation of tightness makes it worse.  

EDIT: It's now tomorrow, and while I still feel like my heart is still a bit ""off"", I feel 90% better. I'm going to see if exercise and breakfast (and maybe some meditation)  gets me the rest of the way there.

Once my health insurance kicks in on the 15th, I will definitely talk to a doctor and see about maybe getting a 72-hour heart monitor. 

Thank you to all who responded. You helped me to calm down a bit even while I was still having these symptoms.

EDIT 2: I'm in the hospital. I have afib. Stress caused it, but I will be okay with medication. So all the times I felt like I was dying, I actually had atrial fibrillation. I'm glad I went in--I will have an ultrasound later this week, but it looks like I will be fine."

0,"Stressed about school Hi Everyone. This is my first time posting here, so I hope I'm in the right place. I'm a 9th grader, and I'm coming on to the last day of my holiday break. Right now I'm struggling with a History report and a Math report (as well as an English assignment, but I can deal with this). They were assigned to me a few days before the break. During the week before the break, I had to deal with a group project in which I was the only one participating. Without going too much into detail, it took a lot out of me and I lost a lot of sleep. I was really looking forward to relaxing during the break, until I got assigned these projects. Anyways, I got home last Friday and I didn't even touch my backpack. I convinced myself that I needed at least a day or so to myself. However, I got ahead of myself. I was planning on beginning my work the day after Christmas, but I didn't. I'm not even sure why, I never procrastinate and I'm always on top of my assignments. I just felt lazy and sleepy, and I didn't even want to think about working (all the while the thought was gnawing at me, and my stomach and chest have been killing me and I'm shaking). I started working on the History project a day ago, and I'm about halfway through with it. I'm going to work throughout the week on the Math project if I don't finish with the History project, as neither are due the day I go back to school. I've been asking my parents for some moral support, but they've been too busy to hang out with me for even 10 minutes (which I don't blame them for, they HAVE been busy). And all I want to do is just sleep. I guess right now I just needed to get this off of my chest, and maybe if anyone has some useful anxiety or school related tips those could be helpful too. Thanks so much for reading this, and Happy New Year."

0,"I have to stop pacing, it is destroying me I do this pacing around the room/house for a long time. I'm 30 now, have been through a difficult separation of a 5 year relationship and i've been pacing for literally miles in my 2 room house. If it's not pacing, it's walking in the town, which is also pacing tbh, just doesn't look like it because it seems like you have a place to go. But really is the same thing, come to think of it.

I've been doing this whenever i felt stressed in the relationship but not only then, in regards to college work or something else.

I remember first doing it very intensely when I was failing my first college year and I was alone for weeks in my parents house. I should've been studying but I was literally pacing for hours around the house. They had a large 4 bedroom apt and rooms were connected in such a fashion that i could walk in circles. And in circles I did walk. Actually no, scratch that. I've been pacing at 5-6 years old when I feared my mother would die whenever she was out at work. That's when pacing started.

My feet hurt now, i'm feeling tingling and heat in my legs whenever I force myself to stop. 

My stress is through the roof now because other than losing my relationship, I had very little friends to begin with and I am now having to face that reality as well. I also changed my profession recently and I have to start working in the new field, which is also stressful, it's like the experience of my first college failure.

I have to stop, i really do. I can sense I am very stressed and at least now it's better because for the last 10 years i've been ignoring this through mindless gaming, browsing, watching youtube/streams and masturbation. I cut those out and am left with this. "

0,"I did it. You can, too. My 2017 resolution was to go for everything. To not let my fears hold me back. It was a direct attempt to address how much social anxiety hindered my life; I was scared to give hugs, talk to strangers, give high-fives or fist bumps, initiate conversation, and break any rules. But today I can proudly say that I think I did pretty damn well at fulfilling that resolution. 

I’m reading back on my journal entries from the earlier part of the year and wow, it’s crazy how much is different. This year I took so many chances, I let myself get hurt, I decided to push away my fear of making mistakes, and I embraced trying new things. And so many things have come from it. My mental state has been through hell but I’m so much stronger now !! 

 I seriously don’t regret any of the choices I made this year. I was so happy and I let go of a lot of my anxiety that comes from social situations. Yay! I finally initiated a hug! And I’m really, really bad at them but I still did it! I asked someone to a school dance! In public! It was terrifying, but they said yes. I went on an overnight snorkeling trip and hated it, but at least I tried! 

Stepping out of your comfort zone is so, so hard. I get it. I had many breakdowns. I had public anxiety attacks. It was definitely not a smooth road. But I’ve improved so much. I’m so happy.

Sorry for this wall of text. I hope that this provides some encouragement to you guys. I used to frequent on here to convince myself that I wasn’t the only one, that my situation wasn’t hopeless. So here I am to tell you that it’s not. It will get better. It is worth it. I promise.

0,"I feel like the rattling tracks as a train passes by in full speed I've been running away forever, running away from my friends, colleagues, LinkedIn Connections and running from 2017, but I fell into 2018, and there's still a feeling that there's something behind, waiting to suck me up as if my back is facing a giant jet turbine.

I don't want to look back and yet my fears persist, they break me down into bite-sized screeches, and I need to be someone with a poorly-fitting mask when I'm not at the mirror, when I'm presenting whatever I am to anyone, wearing a Glasgow smile that makes my face tired, makes me sleepy, makes my head lighter than air and yet heavy as a sledgehammer. I take deep breaths, but I sound like a buffering video, and sometimes I forget to breathe. It becomes voluntary, and I have a feeling of not wanting to do it.

There's no symbolic ticking that ticks me off, going on and off in my head, there's a continuous, persistent hum that never shuts up, a tinnitus that never existed that will continue to haunt me until it breaks me. It makes my head hurt. I'll never know its reasons, I'll never know why I feel so paralyzed by it even with nothing to cause it. I want to get out, but I know there's no getting out of any place or anything, because the only thing I really want to get out of is myself."

0,"Looking for Support in Weaning off Zoloft Hi everyone, so I'm a 24f that started taking 25mg of Zoloft when I was 13. Over the years, I have increased my dose to 100mg. I think I am a well adjusted, responsible adult. I am a college graduate, I've travelled, and really just been able to do things I didn't know would be possible when I was an anxiety ridden thirteen year old. I am so grateful for the decision my parents and our doctor made to put me on  Zoloft, because it gave me my life back.
However, now I feel the time is right to wean myself off Zoloft. There are side effects that maybe did not affect me back then as much as they do now, and I have been able to attribute some things to the Zoloft that I didn't put together before. 
I have done some research and have tried to prepare myself as well as I can. 
Basically what I'm looking for is some support. My dad is an MD and my mom is an RN. I haven't talked to my dad about it a lot, but my mom is not being overly supportive of me weaning off.  She was in the trenches when I was at my worst, and I think she's afraid of me reverting back to that. She is also a big pill pusher in general, and while I totally get where she is coming from, I am kind of disappointed that she doesn't see how this could be good for me. And if it's not, then I'll go back on it! I have no problem with that. It's just that I was so young when I went on it that I really don't know how I am off of it. Anxiety wreaks havoc when combined with puberty, and I hope that I have learned enough coping skills over the years to thrive off of medication. 
If you've made it this far, thank you. I appreciate all of the words of wisdom and encouragement I've received on Reddit thus far.

0,"Panic attack on New Years So I am a 27 yo female with GAD and I’ve been at a cottage with a group of my boyfriends friends and I had a full blown panic attack tonight. Luckily i excused myself to allow it to happen... and my boyfriend comprforted me for a few minutes. 

I feel guilty for asking my boyfriend of five years to stay with me instead of going back to the party... but when I did ask because I really don’t like to be alone when I’m having a panic attack he left and went back to he party anyway.  

This isn’t the full story of what made me have the panic attack or my history but I just need to vent. I feel at a loss and serious guilt as usual. "
0,"I feel trapped and overwhelmed since my dad offered me this poisonous gift. Too anxious to decide what to do. Tl;dr at the end.

Hi Reddit! Sorry if this is not in the right sub, but I thought you might understand better the amount of anxiety this situation puts on me.

For a bit of context, I have always had severe anxiety, which gives me trouble taking decisions, getting things done, being independent among other things.

So on Christmas my dad gave me a ""present"" that I was to open alone and not tell anyone. It contained a contract: he will give me a huge amount of money (many Ks) if I successfully fill my part of the contract in the next six months. 
He wants me to change things about my behavior and do chores. Like cleaning my room, which is a huge challenge for me. I never have enough energy to really clean my room thoroughly and maintain it. He wants me to keep all the dresser surfaces clear, nothing on the floor, drawers organized at all times, which is something I have never been able to do even when trying. I feel so overwhelmed by chores. He also expects me to clean other areas of the house, the bathroom and kitchen and floor. ( I feel so stupid and lazy and spoiled complaining about this). One other thing is he is imposing me a wake up time. But I just can't. I have hypersomnia (self-diagnosed) and I need to sleep a LOT. I know I can't keep my part of the contract as it is, I will fail.

But there is more to the contract. I can choose to take the money right now but I have to leave the house. And I don't want to do that either. Leaving home and getting my own place is one of the things I dread the most (besides tragic events), I have always been dependent and afraid to live alone because of my panic attacks. 

So now I feel trapped like a rat. I am freaking out. And I feel so pathetic that this is even an issue. I know most people would love to be in my place and be paid to get their own place or even just to do chores. But I hate this situation. I even consider declining the money. I don't need it. I wouldn't even know what to do with it. I hate myself. I'm so lazy and pathetic. 

I should specify that I never got along with my dad and it has always been an issue. We can't have a conversation so I have been avoiding being alone with him in case he brings it up. 

Thanks for reading me. And a happy new year to everyone, I hope in 2018 we learn to cope better with anxiety. 

Tl;dr : My dad offers me money to either comply to his way of living in the house or get out of the house. But I can't do either because I'm an anxious and lazy mess."
0,"New Years Resolutions For 2018 I want to finally do what I’ve wanted to do for a long time. 

I don’t necessarily want to cure my anxiety - I don’t think that is possible. However there are a few things I do want to try and do:

1. Feel less like the need to control all situations and have everything planned out all of the time

2. Stop drinking. It doesn’t help anything, I wake up more anxious than before and always hate the situations I get myself into. 

3. Be less insecure. I want to help my relationship by being more trusting, knowing that he loves me and won’t do anything to hurt me.

4. Finish my degree with a 2:1, put more effort into my last semester and ensure the bright future I always promised for myself.

5. Be happier, calmer and healthier. Stop overreacting to situations, become more happy within myself. Overhaul my diet and get better results from the personal training I’m paying for. "
0,"2017 was the worst year of my life I keep on trying to figure out how I can help myself to make 2018 a better year. 

I went to school for film (editing specifically) and I keep on thinking that I should make a video. With me talking about the issues I had, all the shit I went through and how I want to make 2018 my bitch. But most importantly, thanking the people that have been there for me.

I'm just not sure if it is a good idea. My therapist tells me to have and make goals and I'm just wondering if people think this would help. Have something to look back on and help hold myself accountable when times get rough.

I just keep going back and forth on whether or not I should do it. So I'm asking some strangers for help.

Will this make my anxiety worse? If I make the video, should I make it public? 

Thanks in advance.

0,"Antidepressants aren't working for me. Where do i go from here? I've been on antidepressants for around 4 years. I started with Paxil (which was a JOKE, I don't think they should prescribe that stuff to actual human beings...), then Lexapro, and finally, Zoloft, which I've been on for around 2 years. I was prescribed 150mg, which I decided was much to high a dose for me (I'm a 23 year old female, my weight when I was prescribed that dose was 100lbs.), so I just took 100mgs. I've been doing that for around a year.

I'm still a mess. I have no control over my emotions, my panic attacks and general anxiety lead me to ruin friendships and relationships, I have fits of rage that also lead me to say things I don't mean but obviously can't take back, which has made me a very lonely person because no one wants to be around someone like that. I don't blame them. 

This past year I've done a lot of growing, I've realized how shitty of a person I am, how selfish I am and how I've ruined every good relationship and friendship in my life. I still have no confidence, I'm still constantly paranoid, I'm always worried about my family members dying or something. I live 400 miles away from my childhood home. I have no friends where I live. Everything has gotten worse since starting antidepressants. If I hadn't started them, my anxiety wouldn't have become a ""thing"" and everything would have been fine.

So this year, my goal is to get off antidepressants. So I'm going to do that. But where do I go from here? How do I take care of myself? How do I rebuild my life? How do I make friends? I've ruined so much of my life. I'm 23 and I feel like my life is over. I need advice."

I’m comfortable at the house but I guess I’m so anxious from being exhausted already. Anyway, it’s 9:30 and my goal is to make it until midnight and go to sleep in the room my friends made for me.

I don’t want to be a downer and I don’t want to drink to much bc it will exacerbate the situation so I guess I’m hoping somewhere out there a lovely redditor can give me words of encouragement.

So I've suffered with anxiety now for a while. At the moment I'm at a stage where I'm having better days than bad days but when the bad days happen they are intense. 

I'm on propanolol as and when which does help with settling any panics down but recently the anxiety seems to be coming more physical and I don't know if it's me or something is seriously wrong.

I constsntly feel tired. I always feel pressure in my head and ears. I feel lightheaded nearly all the time. I get weird shocks in my head before sleep and physically hear noises in my head.

Tonight I spit blood which happens often. Only a bit and I know it's probably from my gums as stops quickly but then worry and now at a point of not wanting to sleep as scared I'm going to die. 

I keep telling myself it's okay and if it was something serious you'd feel more serious but I don't seem to worry and then these physical sesnafion happen. They happen and then I worry.

I've been to the doctor's and had blood tests and everything came back fine. I have to go back because of some small blips but the doctor said nothing serious and he isn't concerned. 

I just don't like this. I came off antidepressants in may but surely it's not withdrawal still? 

I'm so fed up at the moment and just want to feel healthy. 

Sorry for such a long post. I guess I just want to know if these physical symptoms are normal and what I can to take my mind off them ? 

Thank you in advance and happy new year ! "

0,"What is your first psychiatric appointment supposed to go like? I had my first ever appointment with  a psychiatrist today. I was so nervous and anxious but also extremely excited to get help. I was excited to tell someone my problems and get feedback. However, that didn’t happen at all.
Right off the bat he seemed so fake towards me. Like he was reading from a script. Nothing about the interaction felt genuine to me. I started telling him about all of my symptoms and issues and he asked a few questions. And after that I didn’t receive any feedback. No diagnosis, no reassurance. Nothing. He was more concerned about the logistics of when I would have my next appointment and upping my dosage of Zoloft. He told me I shouldn’t have guns in my house which made me feel so anxious considering I already have an extreme fear of going crazy which causes me a lot of anxiety.  

And so he just sent me off with a prescription and no advice or feedback. I cried as soon as I left his office. I felt so defeated because I’ve always dreaded getting help and now that I was finally ready it was a terrible experience. 

Is this how these appointments go? They just listen I guess and send you off with medication? I could understand why it might take a few more visits to develop a diagnosis but I figured maybe he would give me some kind of answer. 

Any advice and comments are greatly appreciated. Thanks. "

 Not trying to make this a long post since it’s 5am and I need to sleep. But I’m laying here with a bad feeling in my stomach and mind and I just need help trying to figure out what’s wrong with me because it’s ALWAYS on my mind.

My issue is that every time After I meet someone (usually a person I don’t know well) and I like that person, and I want that person to think good of me, I get a strong feeling of insecurity and I always think about things I said or did that were less good. Even if I know a person likes me I still put myself down with thoughts about how that person dislikes me or thinks bad of me. 

 This happens so often I can’t take it anymore. I’m tired of feeling this way every time I meet someone I really care about, I even get this feeling with some of my close friends, after meeting that person I think ”Hm he acted differently around me, maybe he doesnt like me anymore” or similar thoughts. I understand it probably has something to do with insecurity but I’m not really an insecure person, in fact I am very outgoing and (act) sure of myself. But I also get nervous meeting these people because I care so much about what’ll happen. 

It’s so hard to put into words exactly how I feel but can anyone tell me why I constantly feel and think this way? Is this anxiety? I know a doctor would be better to discuss this with but I really cannot afford one and I figured reddit has alwayd been a great help. Thank you."

I'm terrified of having an anaphylactic reaction so I take Benadryl right away even though I've had allergy tests and they are all negative. Sometimes it happens more than ionce a day.

0,"21M, FIRST TIME HERE, HOPING FOR SOME HELP, THANK YOU ALL. Hi guys never posted here before however I am in a very dark place right now with my life and don't really know how to start this but for a while now I have felt very low and have felt as if I am becoming a different person as I no longer find happiness in myself as I did before, I am a university student also working in retail as well as recently being signed to a modelling agency and I often feel as if I have to put a happy face on everyday and I am honestly tired of having to do this it is physically as well as mentally draining. This feeling came around I would say at least a year ago and I kind of thought that it would pass as everyone does go through periods in their life were they feel low however it seems to have stayed and feels like a black cloud hanging over me which feels worse some days more then others , I come from a very loving family and live with my Mother and Stepfather as well as my younger 3 half siblings, I am very grateful for the luxuries I have in my life however there is so much going on within me some days I often wake up feeling very down for no reason at all feeling very worthless and lonely even though my family are very supportive and caring I couldn't ask for a better family. 

&amp;#x200B;

I believe my mental health has worsened due to finding out through family members that my biological father has been diagnosed with cancer and I guess this has made me realise that life really is so short, as a youngster my biological father was unable to be there for me and my mother due to his lack of love or care and the biggest blessing was my mother marrying again to a man who I can happily refer to as a real father, also a very close family member to me who I once spent a lot of time with has  recently tried numerous times to take their own life and being so distant from them for so long has not been a good feeling and has made me feel quite lonely as I am already an individual who does not really have true friends as I struggle to trust people, there have been many times were I have been invited out by others and have had to make up excuses for reasons not to go. There have been times were I have contemplated taking my own life as the feeling of worthlessness and sadness was at its most high, this feeling is very hard to explain and I am just looking for a bit of clarity on maybe why I am feeling this way or if others have experienced something similar I really would appreciate any help at all.

To individuals at work and university and others I meet I am often commented on being a very outgoing individual with a lot of confidence however deep down I often feel as if inside I am a totally different person which really does make me wonder how I became to be like this. I feel as if I lack the routine I once had in my life before and some days waking up feels as if I am just going through the motions, not long ago I would read everyday and would love to keep a journal to put my thoughts to paper, I remember heading to the gym 5 times a week running twice a week being full of energy living life to the fullest appreciating each day with those around me, where has the old me gone?. Often I have been told by others I am a very good-looking individual and in playful ways people have said"" You love yourself don't you"" or "" you are so cocky"" as I very much take pride in my physical appearance and enjoy doing my best to look as good as I can, the truth is recently I have been struggling everyday to keep a positive mindset and do the things I enjoy, having to put a mask on everyday is a task which I have become very familiar with I just want to know if others have felt the same and I would really appreciate any help which can be given I don't want to give up I don't want to carry on feeling this way I want the suffering to end or at least made easier. Thank you for taking the time to read this I apologise for any grammatical mistakes it is quite late in the night right now. "

It feels like almost the opposite effect.

I’ve developed my own schedule being in college and it’s been the most comfortable I’ve felt in a while.  Going home though I feel so pressured and anxious about conforming to theirs.  Sleeping at an earlier time, being awake at an earlier time, no napping, going to the grocery store early (along with other outings) and if I’m not up I miss out, watching tv at a scheduled time with everyone, etc.  Not going along with it comes with disappointment from my parents, ridicule, and occasionally harsh words.  It just feels like so much I need to fall in line with that makes my anxiety freak out.  Because of my anxiety I struggle sleeping and I lose a lot of the oomph to actually get up and out of my room to do things which of course leads in to a snowball effect of me not being a part of their schedule, getting scolded, becoming more anxious, and repeat.

I get so anxious that I can’t wait to go back to school and be stressed out and anxious over there than be at home.  I hate going home for breaks; and I don’t think I should feel this way but my anxiety proves it for me.

0,"WHAT TRIGGERS YOUR ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION? When we experience an unwanted intense emotion, be it anger, depression, anxiety or something else, often our reaction is more intense than it should be because something has “triggered” us. The result is an overreaction or disproportionate reaction. The easy way to know is to imagine if you had an absolutely perfect life, and if this was the first time that something bad happened to you, would you have reacted the same way? 

What is your trigger? Often it's not the situation itself but the feeling it generates, uncertainty, worthlessness, powerlessness etc. The subconscious remembers the pain of those feelings in the past, especially from trauma and especially from childhood trauma. When it gets triggered, the overreaction starts because the subconscious is telling you this is a life or death, fight or flight situation.

0,"How do I stop stressing about money I’m a teenager and I am super scared that my family will go broke/ not be able to live.

Therapy costs a fuck ton and I feel guilting for having to go through it. It’s not even my place to worry about this because I don’t even know how much my parents make. My dad is good at economics and says that we can handle it but I know we can’t.

My mom has a minimum wage job, my dad works in an office, and we’re paying for my brother’s tuition. I’m so scared that my treatment for mental illness will be the reason why we go broke.

Is there any way I can just forget about the situation? I know worrying doesn’t fix anything but it’s constantly in my mind."
0,"I don’t know how many people here can relate to this but it’s worth a shot... So Im a 21yr old Black guy, and I grew up in a family where my dad speaks pretty much like a stereotypical Black man, and my mom speaks like a stereotypical White women. My dads family (who all speak like stereotypical Black people) lives in the city I live in so I grew up with them, and my moms family lives across the country and I have very little contact with them. I grew up being the only Black kid speaking like a stereotypical White kid (including within my own family), and I was never exposed to other Black people who spoke the way I did, so I have always felt a little awkward. 

How should I cope with this?"
0,"I know I am annoying, I am really trying not to. But how? I hate it when I get a friend and then start behaving like a clingy fuck. That’s why I stop talking to people, because I know that once I get attached I won’t be able to leave and they always leave first.

Why won’t people understand that I worry for them? That I want to talk to them and share ideas and listen and just have a good friend? I know I am clingy and I know I am annoying, I am just worried about people leaving, I worry about their well being, about their health, about wether or not they still like me.

It’s hard as fuck trying to pretend you can be cool for other people when you feel yourself consumed in worry.

0,"I don’t know what I have, or what to do if I do have anxiety I originally posted this in r/ADHD because I have that and I thought people there could tell me if I was just expressing symptoms of ADHD, but I feel like people with actual anxiety could help me loads more on this


I would hugely appreciate it if a few people read and responded, I’m sorry it’s so long I just have a lot of thoughts. I don’t know where to post this at all so I hope that by posting this here I might get some help from some people who think a lot like me. Ok so here’s some vague background information. I’m in high school (male) and I haven’t told anybody that I know that I have ADHD. I have known that I have had it since I was 8 and am medicated. Nobody knows except my parents. I honestly don’t know if I am ever going to tell anyone ever. I used to have no friends up until about 2 years ago. That is when I met my current friends. Up until then I was really unlikable and got bullied a lot and often. Around that time I started caring what people thought about me and I think that is why people started becoming my friend. Fast forward about a year and I have good friends, but I worry a lot. I kept a journal too and I wrote down that I felt like it was for the better and that it was good to worry because if you didn’t worry than people wouldn’t like me. Around that time one of my close friends told me that he genuinely thought I had autism before he met me because I had an IEP for my ADHD (they would take me out of class 5 minutes early and check to see if my work was done). This made me worry even more about how people saw me. Around 2 years ago I also started often putting my hand in my hair and touching my face a lot without realizing it. I also kept digging at my nail beds too when I got nervous. I just thought this was my ADHD. This year has been very different for me. I feel like I totally changed. I am a quiet kid now when I used to be the one who tried to talk the most. I find myself knowing answers but not raising my hand because I don’t want the attention on me. I don’t know what to do though. I have a girlfriend and have a bunch of friends, but I always feel like kinda weird. I don’t think I can describe the feeling fully. I always just feel out of place unless I’m alone. I also have kind of highs and lows where one day I’ll feel good and confident and the next I’ll be a mess and have lots of self doubt. I still often tough my face and put my hands in my hair and crack my knuckles and shake my leg even though I have tried many many times to stop. I have had this feeling that I have something else  than ADHD. I have trouble talking to people too because I don’t know what to say. I find myself a lot happier when I am not face to face with people. I can’t tell what it is though, I read a lot of articles and I think I might have generalized anxiety disorder too but I’m not sure and I don’t know how I would tell. I don’t feel comfortable telling my parents, or telling anyone for that matter. I just don’t know what to do. If you read this far, thank you and I’m sorry this was just a huge rant"
0,"So who else is dreading work tomorrow? *possible TW: self harm* 

So I am going back to work tomorrow after a nice few days off for the holidays. Due to some stuff that happened right before Xmas as well as over the holidays at my workplace (not situations that were my fault or anything, just stuff that happened within the company that will negatively affect my day-to-day; I am more anxious than ever about going in. Additionally, when I have anxiety it sometimes goes into suicidal thoughts. I was in a super manic state earlier and tried to cut myself (husband stopped me). 

My main problem with work though is that I am unhealthily attached to my work. I find my worth/value primarily in my work and I am a huge perfectionist to the point where my work is amazing but I am driving myself insane.

0,"Question about clonazepam/potential withdrawal side effect So I've been taking a low dose of clonazepam (half a milagram a day - sometimes an extra 0.25 if I need it) for about two years now (I'm also on Pristiq and a low dose of a generic version of topamax). I take it to treat anxiety, depression, OCD, PTSD, and PMDD.
In November, I thought I was good enough to go off my clonazepam because honestly it was hard to tell if it was doing anything after being on it so long. I didn't quit cold turkey but I don't think I tapered well. I skipped some days and other days I didn't and just...didn't do it right.
And I was wrong anyway - the clonazepam DEFINITELY helps my symptoms and I want to be on it. So now I'm getting back on it (taking .25 at breakfast and .25 at night). I've noticed recently my heart rate has been a little funny - it seems like it goes up and down a lot depending on whether I'm sitting or standing/moving. It's not severe, just strange. Has anyone else had this side effect and does it go away? I don't know if it's from withdrawing from the clonazepam or now going back on it or if it's totally random.
I'm seeing my psychiatrist in two days, but thought I'd see if anyone had any answers in the meantime. "

If I didn’t sleep then I would be up for more than 48 hours. I don’t feel like I am but I do feel tired. 

I don’t know if this is:

- depersonalization/derealization

- A lexapro side effect

- Just my anxiety

It’s killing me that I don’t know which one is causing this very scary thing. 

I feel like I’m going nuts not knowing if I slept when I very well could have. I think I did but I’m not sure.

0,"Learning to Drive Gives Me Anxiety, 26F wanting independence that comes with driving Hi Everyone,

I have made leaps and bounds with many parts of my anxiety. Driving is my Everest however. I’ve had two unfinished driving school stints. Numerous family members and friends trying to teach me. I can’t get the hang of this. 

I’d like to learn this year. I’m going to be getting married this year and will hopefully have children in the next couple of years. I don’t want to be just learning with little ones in the car.

I hate the idea of driving alone, the amount of attention required to drive, I fear the reactions of other drivers to my driving. I feel like I can’t breath when I think about it.

0,"On New Year's Resolutions I'm subscribed a meditation app and I saw a great suggestion for New Year's resolutions:

They suggested not setting yourself hard goals which you can fail and beat yourself up with, but rather on what kinds of qualities you want to have as a person.

This will give you room to improve, even if it's slight, you can say you became slightly more x(organized, respectful, kind to yourself, etc.).

I think those of us with mental health issues can easily struggle with failure, and then we tend to make a hard commitment and when we fail once it twice, we tend to think of ourselves as failures. I love the idea of making progress towards becoming who you want to be, growing into your desires rather than setting harsh limits on what you're allowed to do.

Just something to keep in mind. It's okay to fail. Just keep trying."

In september I met someone new and we started dating. Its been alot since then but it went well for the most part. We traveled alot together and I ended up meeting her parents and all. After we got back on the way home I had a massive panic attack and we had to stop and I had to get out of the car and walk for like an hour to calm down. Finally calmed down, made it to our hotel okay, made it home okay but then it started up again. Gf decided to stay with me to help me calm down but then she had to leave.

0,"[potentially triggering] how does your anxiety/panic present itself? And several other questions. [Potentially triggering]

Last week I had my first panic episode in a LONG time and then had another pretty severe one last night. I’ve had a bit of a “hangover” from my episode last night all day today and I can tell I’m on the verge of another attack because my legs “hurt”. They get restless and I just want to like....take them off my body. I’m not sure how else to describe it. My legs and feet get all tense and I just can’t stop moving. That’s my main symptom that really lets me know I’m not doing well. The leg restlessness/pain...basically I feel like my skin is crawling.

How do your symptoms appear? Gradually or suddenly? What are they? Also, has anyone ever gone to the emergency room due to an attack? If so how did you know when it was time to go? If you would like to message me privately- please feel free! "

0,"Death anxiety, nighttime, and the flu I used to have anxiety about a lot of things, but with therapy I’ve managed to mitigate most of them. One of the remaining things I have is death anxiety. I think the biggest issue is you can’t really rationalize it away because it’s inevitable and...well yeah...don’t want to talk about it.

I’ve had the flu for the past few days. I’ve also been having chest pains. If I’m being honest with myself, it’s probably just because I’m having gastric problems. It’s probably acid reflux. But, I never get sick and I’ve heard that this is how heart problems start with women.

So I haven’t really slept much since I got this flu. I’m sleeping when I get so tired that I just pass out. If I try to sleep any other time, the anxiety just sneaks up on me and I end up getting short of breath and having to stand up and walk it off.

0,"Eating with anxiety I don't really know how to start this post so I'll just jump into it:

Whenever I feel anxious for whatever reason, I feel sick - sometimes bad enough to actually make me throw up. Of course when this happens I have absolutely no desire to eat anything but I'm always told (by parents, doctors etc) to keep eating because 3 meals a day is how to stay healthy and that its good for me but it makes me feel worse at the time.

Sometimes this isn't a big problem if the thing causing my anxiety is early in the morning because then I can eat normally for the rest of the day. If its later in the day however this could make me miss breakfast and lunch which is a bigger issue. 

For example, today I went on a trip out for most of the day and I've been feeling anxious about since I agreed to do it (maybe a week ago), I've been eating fine until today when I couldn't eat any breakfast at all.

My question then is first of all: what is your experience eating with anxiety? Second, is skipping breakfast actualy bad for you - could I have my 'breakfast' late at night instead? And finally does anyone have any suggestions of what to eat that is good in a nutritional way but in as few bites as possible?

(just to be clear, I don't have any kind of eating disorder - just have problems because I feel sick. Thanks for reading of you've made it this far 😊) "

0,"Why do my fathers tantrums get to me so much My (f/26) dad (m/70s) has (fairly minor) anger management issues. He works himself into screaming/swearing tantrums over things like his computer not backing up successfully, or his printer not giving the correct output, or not being able to find his sunglasses.
He’s been this way since I was a kid, he’s prone to “moods” where any and everything will set him off, and goes into the pessimistic “everything is screwed” etc spirals during these moods.

He’s pretty good at not directing the tantrums at my mom and I (i also just avoid him when they start). However, he is also pretty routinely displeased with his life (he’s an extrovert without many friends in a family of introverts - and my mom is nearly reclusive) and he’s a perfectionist, so he never seems to be satisfied with anything in his life for long.
He’s not willing or interested in pursuing therapy and has pretty much stated he’s too old to change. Which is his decision. 

Unfortunately, even though I know these tantrums only last a day or so max and usually concern “the damn printer”, they trigger my anxiety like almost nothing else. I don’t live at home anymore (in school) which helps, but being home for the holidays is difficult because Ik he loves me and misses me, and is hurt by my avoidance of spending time with him. But honestly his moods exhaust me and make me feel sick to my stomach when they start (I’m on an antidepressant which helps but not a ton in these situations), and over the years I’ve found it easier for my peace of mind to avoid being super close to him because I end up weathering fewer of his tantrums.

The issue is we’ve discussed his tantrums and how much they stress me out but he just can’t understand why I take them so personally, and honestly he has no idea how else to express himself at this point (and is unwilling to learn). But he is also supporting me financially during school (which I am so thankful for) so me saying “if you can’t find a different way to express yourself while I’m home I won’t have a relationship with you” isn’t an option (plus id miss my mom and it would cause problems between them).

So very (sorry!) long story short- how do I cope with the anxiety increase while I’m home, and feel less guilty when my dad is hurt that I’m avoiding him?

Tldr: dad has tantrums and gets very loud and upset which triggers my anxiety. How do I deal while I’m home?"
0,"My least favorite thing about anxiety I try to mitigate the emotional effects of my anxiety disorder. I cannot control the hand I’ve been dealt so the best thing I can do is suck it up and deal with it. 

Some days I am better at that than others.

But the worst  thing... the worst fucking thing about anxiety is the “heartdrop moment”. I can be going about my day completely unaffected and then something to be anxious about will pop into my head. 

My heart drops, I get dizzy, I feel weak, my mouth dries up. 

Normally I can calm myself down, practicing a coping mechanism to prevent myself from spiraling into an uncontrollable state.  

Even then, though, the instants of anxiety are draining. My body takes a good 5~10 minutes to normalize again, and it roots itself in the back of my mind. I cannot feel “safe” until awhile later. This happens constantly to me. I cannot ever relax because it feels like my brain might betray me at any second and flare up my anxiety, forcing me to, once again, spend the mental energy calming myself down and ignoring the nagging feelings that I cannot fully escape.

Any time I get together with friends, I find a way to convince myself afterward that everyone actually hates me, someone is talking shit about me, and people are just putting up with me and I don’t actually offer anything to the group. 

I get afraid that I will never hear from my friends again because they’ve decided I’m not fun to hang out with. Or that someone from the group will start realizing negative things about me (or maybe they had a bad experience with me) and will convince everyone else that I’m not worth the friendship.

0,"Value of therapy Hi all,

Therapy makes me anxious (the whole situation/context/relationship/etc). I’m trying to work out whether it’s worthwhile to stick with it, or if I’m just making things worse by deliberately putting myself in a situation that I know will make me anxious.

If you’ve had therapy for anxiety (eg GAD), did/do you find it helpful? If so, in what ways did it help? How long did you go before it felt helpful?

Is anyone else terrified of being there? Did you get over it? How?

Thanks"
0,"Why the hell do i keep doing this to myself I'm a spineless weak willed twit. I hate cocaine, i hate how it makes my nose hurt, how it screws up my sinuses, how it moves everything into overdrive like one of my less severe manic attacks.

Is obviously not working its magic on my pleasure centers so why is it so cam hard to walk away from? I put the liquor down with hardly any effort once the response my body had to that became too much, but it's delightful compared to what cocaine does to me.a

0,"Anxiety and Panic about work. Physical symptoms approaching I have always had anxiety about work. If it was my part-time highschool job to my post college career I am in now. There has always been anxiety, the pieces have just been shaded a different color.

Thinking back, I have washed to much time, energy and mental capacity on worrying about things which didn’t occur in retrospect. Unnerved mornings, sweat covered nights and random panic attacks throughout my day.

I have recently been encountering physical symptoms. My right arm, leg, and body have been tingling and stif for a number of weeks. have been had ER visits and my general practitioner has referred me over to neurology. I am concerned about what the entails, and even more concerned if my anxiety could be the cause of it. This leads to more anxiety over worrying about the symptoms. (Very spiraling I know)

I have been attempting to keep things in check with medications, but that is oftentimes not fruitful. I am beginning to believe that my brain is destined to be involved with anxiety and panic at a core level. I have dealt with it for close to 20 years and while there are slivers of brightness, often it is fleeting."
0,I need help this year My parents don’t believe in mental health and how it can be an issue. And they don’t approve the idea of me seeing a therapist. I saw a therapist once and my mother didn’t feel comfortable taking me to my appointments and that was that. Well I can say 2018 was horrible for me. I went to college and that was all. I suffered from trichotillomania but recently stopped for about four months. I went through a bad breakup but I’m still here. I live with my parents still and my goal for 2019 was to learn how to drive or to get a job. But my anxiety keep me from going to my interviews and actually going on the first day. I just get overwhelmed and I never go through with it. I hate myself and my stupid anxiety and I don’t know what to do anymore. Should I learn how to drive first? Start small and then drive myself to my appointments? Should I get a job first? I feel like I’m stuck and I’m tired of being in this bubble I created for myself. I want to be independent and live my life but I’m so scared.

0,"Best way to not worry/get anxiety about my job Hello Everyone!

I’m new to this page, so let me know if this isn’t appropriate for this page.  I just started a new position in my company, and it’s something that I’ve struggled with regarding anxiety and constantly worrying. 

My job roll is to settle bodily injury claims, and I constantly think and stress about my decisions when evaluating everything. The stress has caused me to be nervous and not allow me to leave work at work, and focus on myself or my SO at home. 

Does anyone know how to deal with a high stress job? I haven’t been getting a lot of physical exercise recently, and that might be one way to help (I’ve been wanting to join an adult ice hockey team for a little while, so I might do that). 

Any advice or life stories would be greatly appreciated. Happy New Year Everyone!"
0,"Anxiety and nausea/vomiting? I'm curious as to how some of you have effectively treated this. 

I'm wondering if this is simply one single problem or two separate issues. The main problem is severe reoccurring episodes of intense anxiety, severe nausea, intermittent abdominal pain and frequent vomiting. Could be once a year, could be 5 times a year. Symptoms can last a day or several days, leading to restlessness, lack of sleep and dehydration. 

Stress and menses could possibly be a trigger of sorts but otherwise there seems to be no pattern other than a ""feeling"" of an episode coming on followed by a slow build up of symptoms. 

Most oral antiemetics don't work when it becomes a full blown episode and then once the vomiting starts, obviously nothing will stay down. Taking stuff like Zofran, promethazine, Compazine etc may slow down the effect but generally doesn't abort it in severe cases. 

We've basically been to numerous doctors, a GI specialist. Lots of things have been ruled out but there was never a definite diagnosis. Everything is essentially normal medically speaking. 

So my question is: has anyone experienced similar symptoms and what proved to be the best treatment?

0,"Bad anxiety and my relationship, can anyone relate? It’s not really a big deal but I have a “long distance” type relationship. We’re not really dating but we kept in touch after I moved. 

I know he likes me a lot. He gave me a cd of a song he wrote after I left his house one morning. He gave me a letter talking about how much he liked me. The day before yesterday he told me he would daydream about seeing me again. He’s a very shy, awkward and not at all foreword person, that’s how I know it’s genuine. I’m pretty much the opposite. 

Everytime we FaceTime though, and we get off I always overthink everything I said. I think I am so boring and annoying. I always beat myself up and need constant affirmation that he likes me. 

It’s time to leave him behind, there’s no point in stressing over a relationship that won’t work because of distance. 

I just need advice on how to not do this and if there’s anyone that relates to this. 

Thank you!"

I’ve also noticed that my mood changes literally within minutes. I can be happy, positive, motivated, and satisfied one moment.... then not even 5 minutes later, I’ll be thinking negatively, won’t be happy, I’ll have no motivation to do my hobbies, ETC. This gets 3X worse whenever on LSD. I can go from strong feelings of happiness &amp; bliss to a negative headspace where I just CAN’T be positive. I’m not sure as to what this could be at all because I’m not sad and nor do I express any clinical depression symptoms besides the mood issues. Do any of you go through this?

So, I’ve been turning to a couple shows, and wanted to know which, if any, do you like to watch?

0,"Need Reassurance - Frightened I Will End Up Like My Dad, who has PTSD/Schizophrenia In the last 6 months, I have really struggled hard with derealization and anxiety; in the last few weeks, more of the latter.It is accompanied by obsessive thinking about fearful, intrusive thoughts, random spurts of heightened tenseness and panic, a general feeling of doom/emptiness, and more of that fun stuff.

Anyway, most of my life, my dad has lived with PTSD, earlier diagnosed as schizophrenia, brought on by a horribly turbulent, abusive and traumatic upbringing in his earlier years. His most predominant struggle with the illness(es) is that he hears voices (auditory/verbal hallucinations) that appear very realistic and are hostile and aggressive, and he is also paranoid/suspicious about random things. I have lived through some of his darker episodes and periods of these illnesses and seen and heard and experienced him doing some crazy, worrying, heartbreaking and infuriating things, and I believe as a result of being subjected to a prolonged and continuous amount of that stuff, it has left me with some mild anxiety issues over the years, however, in the last 6 months, out of nowhere, it has gotten immensely worse, along with my derealization. He has been in a comparatively far more stable state now for the better part of 2 years, but now in recent times, I have this obsessive, frightening, horrible fear that I too will start hearing things that aren't there and basically end up like my dad. It's causing me unbelievable distress and panic, and I'm constantly plagued with this ominous feeling and question the reality of subtle, more quiet noises, in fear that I am imagining them (i.e. little noises, like creaks in the house, high frequencies, etc.).

Can someone please tell me how to stop this ruthless thinking cycle and also explain the chances of (i know this sounds illogical) getting PTSD/schizophrenia if you've had a parent with it?

Thank you and sorry for the lengthy post"
0,"2019: came home to a nightmare I was away on a trip for a week. A WEEK. My lease for my apartment is up next month, and I was wondering when I’d get my new lease.

I left for my trip and came back to the lease. $500 more this year than the last!!! I can barely afford that...I couldn’t sleep, spent all night crying and worrying and not knowing what to do. I LOVE this place but it doesn’t feel safe anymore. I look at other apartments but nothing feels right. I sent my poor SO like 40 texts of me panicking.

Then; I tried to sleep..but couldn’t, because of fucking MICE in my kitchen! What?? I’m organized and don’t leave food out. I don’t understand. Slept a little...got up to clean, and...there were 2 spiders, 1 HUGE blocking my cleaning supply. What. The. Hell. I am terrified of spiders but need the cleaning supply to clean up mice droppings

Oh and the SO I mentioned earlier? He’s perfect. Except, he has anxiety too, and has no idea whether he can have a future with me or not. But loves me and wants to try. This is somewhat old news but ugh it’s all compounding

Therapy also went up 3x the amt due to my insurance changing. I doubt my therapist will let me visit every 3 weeks.

Is this a joke? A nightmare?"
0,"Less procrastination, less anxiety, less depression Im a student now in the third year of college. Last autumn 2017 (second year of studying) i was trying to catch up with missing courses from first year, but i got very depressed and couldn't study at all and failed my courses again... I stayed home and got isolated since i had no social context or friends to hang out with, spiraling my anxiety and depression. I was sure everyone hate med. Things like going to the supermarket to buy food was extremely difficult. All the anxiety and failing to study made me feel like shit and worthless. This made my anxiety and depression spiral downwards.

&amp;#x200B;

In januari 2018, i began new courses, this time i went to the lectures and didn't stay home. I joined a procrastation support group, for students which have the same problem. The group meet up once a week and you set goals and evaluate yourself and e.g. get plus or minus if you met the personal goals for the last week, you then set new goals for next week. It might sound terryfying and harsh, but everyone in the group is very friendly and supportive. You set your own goal and noone judges, cause we all struggle with the same thing.  In the group i got new friends to hang out with and realised im not the only one struggling with procrastination and anxiety when studying. This combined with other things in my life like finding new friends, and joining activities made me feel way better this year. The spring was hard, but i got a little better at studying. Eventually this fall i progressed alot in procrastinating less. I made and followed my schedules and structure which have shown results in my studies. The structure makes me being able to relax when coming home, knowing i studied enough today. The result is my stress and anxiety go down alot. Compared to 1 year ago, life feels feels amazing. (Ofcourse this isn't the only reason, alot of other things affected my mental health aswell)

TLDR: Was very depressed, failing at studiying . I joined a procrastination group among other things, am less depressed and i have less anxiety towards studying which feels amazing :)"
0,"Positive escitalopram (Cipralex/Lexapro) experiences for high-functioning individuals I might be starting 2019 off with my first anti-depressant. My GP has suggested escitalopram based on my symptoms. Over the past 3-4 months (out of no where) I have experienced a few panic attacks and very high baseline anxiety. I also experienced mid-level depression that has fluctuated to periods of major depression. 

Essentially I've begun to get anxious in normal situations (talking to co-workers) and have experienced a strong diminishment in enjoyment of normal activities (my job, sports, etc). 

I believe that multiple life events in a short timeframe have created this situation (marriage, new home, new job - within a 12 month period). 

I'm looking for any experiences that high-functioning individuals have had on this anti-depressant. What I mean by ""high-functioning"" are just people that are actually working full-time jobs, have a supportive family, have friends and interests outside of work, are eating correctly, are working out and taking care of their bodies, are not abusing drugs, etc. As the research I have done suggests that SSRIs work significantly better for those in a high-functioning state (but experiencing a depressed/anxious disorder). 

Please comment on what escitalopram has done for you. 

Specifically looking for comments on: 

* Anxiety 
* Depression
* Motivation
* Focus 
* Happiness 
* Extraversion "

They then proceeded to change my social media accounts and gain access to my visa and debit card due to them being in the phone case.

As I was trying to call the bank to get everything cut off I couldnt find the number anywhere (this always happens in my dreams) so I could basically do nothing.

I thought of creating my own Discord server designed for this exact thing but it's going to take some time it seems. I also looked into some support-groups online but it appears they've been extinct for some time (some forums haven't seen activity since the early 2000s).

I know this isn't exactly the *correct* place to ask this, but since you can technically experience a mimicked version of Anxiety through Essential Tremors I feel that this is acceptable.

This year terrifying in the context of change. I'm not that bad when it comes to change, and im pretty adaptive with it too. But I'm terrified because getting a job, getting a liscence and eventually taking care of myself is a really hard thing to realize. I can't sleep normally some nights, and I find myself being slumped in bed all day not getting anything done, and feeling even more worthless because I didn't do anything. So I'm in a perpetual cycle of just self loathing and self hatred and laziness. I cant tell if this is depression, or actual laziness. 

Job interviews scare the hell out of me, and I hate phone calls. I used to be better with in in my last job, but long story short i worked with my abusive ex at the time. And she was the one that helped me get the job in the first place. Ive always thought I wouldn't have gotten the job if it wasnt for her.

Im excited for that aspect of it, but everything that comes with constant pressure to perform for superiors and dealing with disagreeable people in the work place, makes me want to cowar in a corner, cry and beg to never leave and to have me shot. 

I don't know if others can relate to this. And I know I'm just trying to make excuses not to work, but working isn't the issue for me... I'm a really hard working person when it comes to giving me a task. Im really quick with it too. But its the process of actually GETTING a job that makes it so fucking horrifying. 

If I don't, I'll most likely have to leave college for a while, and live with my parents up until i actually find a job to work. I feel so useless and worthless, and I just don't know how to get over my anxiety over it all. 

Im sorry for my rant. 

TLDR: im worthless and scared of job interviews, and working in general because people terrify me from judging me, and I cant get over my fear of it. I need a job soon so i can be a real adult and stop having my parents still take care of me. "

1,"I have no friends, but I have so many. Throwaway account. 
I am so tired of feeling consistently lonely. I have friends, but I am afraid to talk to them for fear of judgement, rejection, guilt, misunderstanding. 

I just want friends that I can say, ""I really need to self harm."" 
And have them understand what that feels like 

But guess what? I do.  I do have those friends, but I still have that want/desire. 

I have a great boyfriend, but I still feel so lonely and trapped in my own mind. 

I want to self-destruct. I have so much anger that I need to release, and I typically internalise it.  I haven't self harmed in months and I don't want to let me family down if I do. 

I just need help so much, but I always reject the help out of fear.

1,I’m thinking about admitting myself to the psych ward I’m having really bad episodes and I’m ruining relationships left and right. I haven’t even begun treatment for bpd because I’m still in the process of being diagnosed. I’m thinking about admitting myself to the psych ward for a week as an attempt to stop spiraling down and help get my life back on track. Does anyone have experience or think it would be helpful?
1,"Girlfriend has BPD, need help discussing things with her.. Hey everyone, first time posting here so please excuse any errors ive made, or if its not appropriate feel free to delete the post...

My girlfriend and I had an argument over the last couple of days, she was being quite distant, and ive not experienced that from her since we've been together. So i asked her about it politely, ""i feel like you've been a little distant lately, is everything okay, i feel like ive been left in the dark"". To which she got a bit defensive and angry, things spiraled out of control a little and we had an argument over nothing.
Im trying to write her a letter currently, and im basically trying to open up to her, to let her know that i am here for her to talk to if she needs me, however im not going to force her to talk. 
Ive not dated someone with BPD before, so this is all a new experience, and im trying my hardest not to mess anything up because i really love her. Basically i have a letter written out but i want someone whos more familiar with BPD to proof read it, incase anything ive written in there comes across in the wrong way. PM me and ill happily copy paste the letter to you. its about 3 pages long though. Im not sure how much detail i should've gone into with this post but if theres any more context needed, reply to the post and ill see what i can answer. 

Thanks in advance for any help, much appreciated &lt;3 "
1,"Dealing with the loss of my life I am 31 years old and a quiet borderline. When I was a child my mother and I would have horrible fights full of swearing and screaming. As I got to be a teenager it was almost daily swearing at me and calling me all sorts of horrible things.  I would end up bawling in my room just boiling with rage at her practically every day. I never told anyone about what was going on, because I felt it was my fault for being a brat and for treating her terribly. I felt too ashamed and guilty to let anyone know, I thought they would think I was a terrible person. 

It's hard to explain to other people because trauma is easily understandable when its physical or sexual abuse, and it wasn't that with me. It was constant daily verbal abuse from my mother, and a father who was over-protective, babying, and treated me as if I was incapable of doing anything myself. The verbal abuse from my mother would make me feel so out of control, so small, so helpless. I would fantasize about killing her all the time. My mother would always tell me I was a horrible person, and though I would tell myself she was wrong, her belief eventually seeped inside me. I hated myself so much. I have never allowed myself to think a positive thought, or feel a moment of joy, because when I do, I would feel a huge torrent of guilt and self hate come over me.

I was an outgoing child with friends in elementary school, but when I entered middle school my friends rejected me, started bullying me. That’s the point in my life where I totally imploded. Everyone in my life hated me and treated me as inferior. I wasn’t safe with anyone. I don’t know if anyone has seen the movie Get Out, but that’s the moment that I went into the Sunken Place and never came out. I have never been able to be comfortable around anyone, I am stiff and fake.  Interacting with people is just constant paranoia. In high school I tried to put on a fake smile to the world, but my peers could sense my insecurity and no one liked me. 

My way of coping became to dissociate, and I've been dissociated for 20 years. I’ve spent the last 20 years mostly on the internet, living in a fantasy world to distract me from loneliness. I have also engaged in very unhealthy binge eating. I have always known in the back of my mind that I am punishing myself. Punishing myself for treating my mom badly. Even though I know this is irrational, I have not been able to stop the feelings that cause this behavior, and then the behavior itself. Words cannot describe how it feels to be stuck in the sunken place, aware of everything you are doing but unable to stop yourself, pounding on the walls and screaming to stop, as you watch yourself waste and ruin your entire life, and destroy your health and appearance. 

I am now a 31 year old “adult"". Or so I appear to be to other people. I am supposed to have a lifetime of experiences under my belt. I haven’t experienced anything at all. I never ever had any friends. I’ve never kissed anyone. Never been to a party. Never held someone at night. Never danced. Never giggled, been silly, or had a moment of fun.  I graduated college, but only spent one semester on campus and didn’t make any friends or have any experiences. I never grew up at all. 

 I look “mature”, probably older than my age, but I am really still an insecure 16 year old. i have a lot of white hairs, due to poor sleep, long periods of inactivity, stress and poor diet. My face looks very serious and lined, and my soft attractive skin and hair is gone. I still live with my parents, and the negative relationship, though it’s less explosive, still affects me. I have had a series of minimum wage customer service jobs that are a nightmare because I am terrible at them, incompetent and can’t remember anything. The social aspect of these jobs with the co-workers also go terribly and it’s a nightmare to be in them. 

Now that I’ve lost most of my life, my entire youth, and ruined my appearance, and perhaps my health since I’ve recently developed knee and other problems, I can feel myself coming into reality more, less dissociated, less in the fantasy world. The loss of my life is too great. Too horrible to comprehend. I cannot accept it. It can’t be reality. I had so many dreams. I can still feel them, taste them.  So many things I wanted to experience and achieve.  I do not see anything positive to look forward to in my future. I am especially upset about the loss of my physical appearance and body. My body does not produce the sorts of hormones that make for that youthful exuberance or romance I always dreamed of anymore. 

Part of the self punishment I engaged in was to make myself physically unattractive through bad eating and lack of exercise. I know some people don’t care a lot about appearance and view it as a shallow concern, but it has always been important to me. I’ll never get to experience the kind of sensuality that comes from being attractive and young anymore. My skin disgusts me, it’s grizzled and old. I can’t see anyone I’m attracted to being attracted to me, and even if they were, sex and romance is ruined by the changes in my appearance. This *tortures* me. 

Even if I grabbed life by the reins now, it wouldn't make up for what's lost. All I can see in my future is deep disappointment and sadness. It is too horrible for me to comprehend and face. I don't know what to do. 

**TL;DR**  Trauma from my childhood set me on a path of self-punishment that involved hiding myself away from the world and people, dissociating into a fantasy world on the internet, and self-destructive and unhealthy binge eating habits. At 31, I have not lived any life, had any experiences, and I've ruined my physical appearance and possibly my health. That I've lost my life is too horrible for me to comprehend or accept. Even if I grabbed life by the reins now, it wouldn't make up for what's lost. All I can see in my future is disappointment and deep deep sadness. I don't know what to do."
1,"I love my BPD friend. She cuts herself up, swallows razorblades, etc. I love it. Its part of her psyche, I love it.

Am I sick?"
1,"My mother found me after I overdosed and left me there I'm a 19 year old former uni student. I dropped out of studying for a degree in manufactured engineering just before christmas. I moved out of the city I'd lived in these past 4 years and moved back in with my mother.

We argued a lot, or to be more accurate I'd piss her off by not realising x thing needed doing (because she wouldn't say anything, just silently fume) and she'd yell at me. Tell me I'm disgusting, lazy, not mentally ill, dirty, vile. She told me, a borderline personality sufferer, that I'm a manipulator. That I use people... that I'm a train of self destruction that hurts everyone in my life and leaves them.

She's been this way all my life, and started saying this stuff to me when I was around 10. I finally realise that she doesn't actually believe these statements, rather she remembers things I've mentioned. She knows I'm scared of becoming a user and she decides to hurl it at me because she knows it'll hurt me. She says statements knowing that it'll hurt, and when I cry she raises her voice, then yells about me acting like a baby by crying. She takes enjoyment out of belittling me when she's hurt by something that I've accidentally done.

So christmas eve I took a overdose of dihydrocodeine and amitriptyline. I took about 15 pills each. I began to fall asleep whilst eating pizza in the evening. My mother kept shouting me and asking me ""how can you sleep sitting up?"". I could still respond at this point but in a slurred way, saying I was just very tired.

I went to bed. My mother promised me that she would wake me in 20 minutes, so it'd be a nap as it was only 6pm ish. My last memory is sitting on my bed as she promised me she'd wake me.

I woke at 3am with no memory of what I'd done, hallucinating. Every time I'd close my eyes I'd see something, and when I opened them I'd see even more disturbing things. I have hallucinations due to BPD so it didn't disturb me too much.

I woke my mother up around 11am christmas day with a coffee. Later in the day I began remembering what had happened, my overdose and asked her if she tried to wake me. She looked at me and said ""I tried, you wouldn't wake up. I shook and pulled you and you carried on asleep. So you overdosed?"". I admitted it. She just nodded. She didn't look upset or angry or even empty or defeated, just mildly annoyed. I asked her why she didn't phone an ambulance. She just said I was still breathing.

My life has gone into shambles. I sleep on my mothers fold up bed in the hallway of her one bedroom flat. I have no friends, no purpose, nothing. I live with a soul destroying mental illnesses which leaves me on the verge of abusing people regularly, and in an effort to not hurt people I hurt myself through cutting and burning and using drugs and alcohol, and have done for nearly 10 years.

I am heavily scarred, most are keloid. Red and purple and silver keloid scarring, raised and dents in my skin, all over from my arms to my breasts to my legs. I pissed myself the other month because the prescription painkillers, the constant use for years have done something to my bladder. I suffer with stomach pains due to the amount of pills I regularly take. I have no job, and considering the fact I can't even talk to people without stuttering and struggle to do basic things like go to the supermarket or talk to strangers it's no easy feat to get a job. Still I had a volunteer job at my old city, but I live too far away now.

I'm broken, finally broken, and my own mother left me knowing I could die, because only a stupid person can walk on somebody unconscious and unable to wake and decide that theres zero chance that person will die.
"
1,"It wont stop. I have very little patience for anyone anymore. I don't trust anyone and my views on others are warped to the point where any interaction in real life with someone I'm completely dead inside because I have always been isolated and alone with my intense thoughts and feelings. 

I've learnt overtime people just don't care and allowed myself to be slowly buried into a pit of expressing myself less and less. I'll hide and never reach out, because every time I do I get nothing other than finding out I was lied to, manipulated or they'll never care as much as I do.

I grew up with an unstable family full of abuse. I wasn't brought up right and I've never known how to interact with others properly. I was always bullied in school by other girls and I've been beaten up multiple times. I had no security growing up and while I'm an adult now I feel like I'm slowly fading away. My feelings are so intense that when I feel down I'm immediately ready to get a knife or pop some pills and end everything.

1,"sore throat taking trileptal Hi, its been only 4 days or 5 since i have been taking trilepatl and my throat hurts..I have read that it could be because of the med and you need to call your doctor but  how would you know that its caused by trileptal and not normal sore throat? should i stop the med? should i lower the dosage? thank you...i am worried and want to avoid talking to the doctor as much as possible because i have social anxiety aswell."
1,"Having a really rough time. Just need to vent. Just want to preface, that I have no idea how to express myself and I hope this makes sense.

Little back story. I was diagnosed with BPD at 19, but of course being the iamverysmart teenager that I was, I rejected the diagnosis along with PTSD. Fast forward to recently, I've been seeing a therapist and psychiatrist to help treat depression. I stumbled across this subreddit and /r/BPDmemes and couldn't help but really relate to what I've read. To some degree I don't want to accept that maybe just maybe the doctor was right after all. I do plan to discuss this with her at our next appointment.

Which brings me to today. I can feel my depression sneaking in on me, but I know what triggered it. I tried to discuss my past diagnosis with my husband, and how I was currently feeling very lonely. His reaction was less than supportive to say the least. I feel like I'm just burdening him even more than I already have. I feel like he hates me, or at least doesn't like me very much. I feel like he wishes I was out of his life. Whatever the reason is, he just won't talk to me about it. At the same time, I don't know if I'm losing my mind. Am I wrong for wanting to discuss this? Have I done something wrong to justify this response? I just don't know. All I know is that I'm currently hiding in the bathroom crying trying to get this out.

I don't know. I'm sorry. Thanks for reading."
1,Pregnant in UK Hello all. I am looking for some advice regarding accessing services particularly in the UK. I am nearly 4 months pregnant and my mental health has been getting worse since being pregnant but it has always been sketchy. I am single as my partner of 6 years left me and I’m struggling to accept this I feel like actually stabbing him to death but then I just want him to see me again. I can not control my emotions and I end up being abusive to medical staff verbally but more to Myself like head banging and wanting to kill myself because I’m a horrible person. I do compulsively text phone and bang on front door of my ex. My midwife suggested to refer me but I’m terrified they will involve social services and then my baby will be taken. Does any one have experiences of being pregnant with bpd Thank you

When i got the news i screamed for about 2 minutes then cried histerically then went into shock and just stared. This man has been more of a father to me than my own father. He has been my saving grace during my dark days. My emotions are all over now. One minute crying, next just staring, then laughing. I really dont know how i will cope with this. 

Has anyone been through something similar?"
1,"Almost Done With IOP... Here's What I've Learned A few months ago I was frequenting this sub while waiting for my Intensive Outpatient Program for DBT to begin. Once the program started, my entire world ended (check my post history if you care, not getting into it here). I graduate the program on Thursday,  and here's what I've learned so far.

1. This sub is not helpful for recovery. While it *feels* better in the moment to bitch and get it out, that doesn't solve anything and this entire subreddit is toxic to recovery. I'm NOT saying this subreddit is bad - because it is not! - and it totally serves its purpose, but if you genuinely want to get better, this is not the place to do it.

2. Group engagement seems to be the only way to truly learn and use the skills gained in DBT. While self teaching may be the only option for some and is probably better than nothing, our perceptions are quite distorted and we really need someone to guide us and help answer our questions.

3. You are the only person that can make yourself feel better. Don't ruin someone else's life because you feel shitty about yourself and want someone else to make you feel some level of worth.

4. Radical Acceptance ... sounds like a simple concept, is much harder to put into practice, but once you do life is so much more clear. Life happens and there isn't shit you can do about it alot of the time. You can either be upset by it, or accept it. Acceptance does not mean agreement! 

5. Expectations will always lead to disappointment and resentment. Do you expect someone to console you when you're sad? And what happens when they don't? We cannot expect anything from anyone for any reason. We can only have expectations for ourselves, for that is all we have any control over.

There's tons more but these were the biggest things for me.

I appreciate this sub for all the times I felt like I needed to vent. I hope you all seek real recovery if you want to get better from this bullshit and have the option to do so."

I have texted him excessively, I’m really embarrassed and I think he’s blocked my number. 
I’m so embarrassed and sad, I don’t understand why he’s doing this to me, he knows I have had issues but so has he. 

He unfollowed me on Instagram and won’t accept my follow request, it’s just sitting there unaccepted 

He doesn’t even open my snap messages. 

I can’t call him and I don’t understand why he’s doing this. I know I can do better but it hurts me a lot.

1,"Dealing with heart break with BPD I need some advice because the emotional pain I'm feeling right now is so intense I don't know how to deal with it. I've been through break ups before, they're never easy but most have not hurt this much.
For context: I'm a young woman that's been dealing with BPD for a few years now. About a year ago, I got out of a very emotionally abusive relationship. I avoided dating for a while because it destroyed my trust in people. I met someone a few months ago who I instantly felt at home with. I pushed him away at first because I didn't want to deal with the pain all over again, but he didn't give up on me and we were very happy together. Then on christmas eve he dumps me with no explanation. Not a particularly fun situation for anyone to be in, but with BPD it's even worse these emotions are so intense and I don't know how to not go back to unhealthy coping mechanisms. How do you heal?"
1,"I have realized that I’m in hell As in this is actual hell in a very literal, non-metaphorical sense. Maybe in a metaphysical sense. Trial by fire or outright torture? For 30+ years now I’ve pushed forward, isolated completely. There was no help when I was younger, especially not for males. Now I struggle with every aspect of life, not for lack of trying again, and again, and again. I am a joke or a threat to neurotypicals, and a shame to my family. Typical BPD reaction to blast all this on the internet in a moment of weakness, but the joke is I’ve been on the internet since 1995 and probably have spoken less than 10 pages of text to anybody ever. This last outing was just as demeaning as all the other attempts to break out of my shell, so here’s goes one last futile attempt to collect my fractured thoughts into a cohesive collection. I’ve always believed the way out is through, but the deeper into hell I get the more I’m looking at the emergency exit. “The easy way out” hah, well easier than 40 more years of this shit I suppose. The only question I keep wondering is if i do it, does it all just end (yes please if only), or do I just get reborn into a new, more twisted hell? Can’t help but feel like the latter is the true reality. Is my reality just this stupid dumb reality? Is everybody else the real reality? Anyways, sorry for this meaningless wall of text, for those of you that read it. I know this sub is supposed to be a safe space for venting thoughts, or at least I’m hoping so. I hold so much of this shit inside because nobody wants to hear it, and the little that leaks out always makes people hate me for not just “getting over it”. I’m tired and worn out so going to go sulk in my pity party now, but thanks for providing a space for me to shuffle my thoughts out into the great void, where they can be swallowed by the abyss. I know, melodramatic."
1,"Sexual abuse - 11 years on, I'm no longer ashamed, I'm enraged Trigger warning: discussion of sexual violence

I have a lot of problems. It was because I had so many problems that I came across so many predators as a young girl. These assaults happened and I was told I was a slut, and I believed them. Even when I grew older and gained more knowledge, I felt like a dirty piece of garbage. I stayed silent and now there's no chance I could lay criminal charges against these monsters because I was made to believe it was my fault. My faultiness. But each year since these crimes, I have learned more and more that I'm not at fault. I was a victim. I knew this intellectually, but not emotionally until now. Now that I've been talked down to and demonised for showing my trauma. People close to me have made me feel like my behaviour is crazy, but they have no idea of my history and I'm fucking tired of it. My own boyfriend can't even listen to my history because it makes HIM feel uneasy that the world can be a meaninglessly cruel and incredibly painful place. I'm tired of protecting people, including my attackers and abusers. It just hit me emotionally - this wasn't my fault. The abuse wasn't my fault and the trauma that followed wasn't my fault. I'm tired of hiding the scars on my wrists, I tried to kill myself no less than a month after I was stone cold raped. I was raped and no fault of mine can justify that. That has hit me emotionally. The shame was stifling and choking the justifiable fucking rage of someone who has been wronged. I'm tired of everyone in my life dismissing this and dismissing my pain. Why should I be alone as a victim of crime and someone with a mental illness? People who are mugged or frauded are afforded some fucking sympathy. People with cancer are afforded some understanding. I'm tired of the shame I've carried for this. I don't deserve to carry it a day longer!"

However, this past week I've been completely nuts again, crying for no reason, drinking more than usual, self-harming almost daily, causing arguments with my boyfriend for no reason, wondering why I'm even with him, constant suicidal/delusional/paranoid thoughts - all backwards stuff. Then what do you know - I'm on my period now and the rotting feeling in my chest and the tightness in my stomach is all but gone.

I've made progress in 2017. It was a shitty year, but it wasn't my worst. I've made it through worse and will continue to push through. 2018 is a year of many new things. A new semester. A new counselor. A new place to escape from home. 

I hope everyone finds peace of mind in same form this night and the upcoming year."
1,"Happy New Year! It gets better. Hello! 2016 was the absolute worst year of my life. I lost all my friends and felt very alone, etc. I thought life would never get better and I would be utterly miserable forever.

2017 was better. Am I completely happy? No. Do I magically have tons of friends and got rid of my BPD? No. But it was better than 2016. I’m happier. I’m healthier. I’m more content with myself and spending time with myself and working on me. I honestly don’t know if I would be diagnosed with BPD at this point (haven’t been to therapy in almost 2 years so this is just a guess). 

I’m 23 now and I just wanted to encourage you to give it time. You might not ever be completely fixed but I KNOW it will get better. Give it some time, focus on yourself, and I encourage you to put yourself first and remove people from your life that don’t help you stay in a good mental state. It’s hard and 2017 included a lot of alone time working on myself and learning to be content. You got this!!!"
1,"Girls: are you overly flirty and sexual? I am, definitely. I don't get into relationships because of my mental health issues, but I flirt, a LOT. Doesn't matter if it's a guy or a girl, I do it. I have gotten better at controlling myself, though. So yeah, I have had quite a few sexual encounters with friends in the past (no sex, though. I'm still a virgin. I just keep it to kissing, touching, etc) I wouldn't do that with strangers. It makes me feel good knowing I can please somebody else. Any other ladies relate?"
1,"I fucking hate work right now I removed myself from all the gossip a long time ago but I'm still left with the paranoia and I don't trust anyone there. I feel completely isolated, even the people who I once considered a friend have long been distanced, partly because I had time off a year ago from the after effects of a bad drug experience, but mostly because I've closed myself off. There's a lot of shit that I feel most people there know of about me that I wish they didn't know. All I can say is fuck it, accept it and move on but some days it feels like everyone is a trigger and I become so angry sometimes it's difficult to keep it in. I look miserable most of the time and I can barely focus on the work. I need to save up this year and actively search for a new job. Eventually I wish to move out and live in a different place altogether and start fresh and put the past behind me"
1,Do you ever just feel like you create problems for yourself? Acted on impulses. Dealing with the consequences. On the verge of tears.
1,"[Vent] I am legitimately angry That when I got diagnosed at a university clinic, I was not told about the structural dissociation model of BPD, which would have alerted me to the chance that I might have dissociative amnesia, i.e. trauma related memory lapses. Nor was I evaluated for things like freeze, which while not self harm is a significant impairment. My functioning has improved GREATLY in the short time I've known this and I am so angry at the waste of 3 years of my time on ""mentalization."" Or maybe DBT would have helped more than transference based, I don't know bc it wasn't given where I was diagnosed."
1,"New Jersey, Medicaid, Finding Therapist or DBT class Hey all! For, 2018 my goal is to find a good therapist, and just fucking try my best. 

I'm looking for resources or recommendations for anyone who might live in NJ and is on Medicaid. Do you know of any great therapists who have experience with DBT or of any DBT classes?

It's always so hard mustering up the courage/mental energy to make the call/email. That whole fear of rejection vicious cycle thing, you know? Anyway, I know it's what I really need and I'm hoping I can keep the momentum for the new year. "
1,"FP turned off his phone after I apologized I didn’t take my meds for a few days and texted my FP while he is on vacation a bunch of stuff about being suicidal. Today I’m back on my meds and I texted that I hope he’s having a nice day but he had turned his phone off. Then he turned it on so I took the opportunity to say I’m sorry. He turned his phone right off again.

I feel terrible. What do I do?"
1,"Lorde - Melodrama She wrote this album after ending her year-long relationship, describing all the different feelings and phases one goes through after such a breakup, but it really resonates with me and a lot of the lyrics just perfectly describe what it's like living with BPD. I really recommend it to everyone who's into that kind of music, so many feels. 

*The truth is, I am a toy that people enjoy 'til all of the tricks don't work anymore, and then they are bored of me. I know that it's exciting, running through the night, but every perfect summer's eating me alive until you're gone, better on my own.*"
1,"How does one develop a thicker skin? Hello, at work I am pathologically nervous about being perceived as not a good teacher. I teach in a very low income, gang infested area. I get very good test scores, the parents like me, the kids love me, I have great classroom management, good reviews, etc.  But I'm at a new school with a new principal. She or her assistant are always in my room critiquing and saying I need to do this or that instead of doing what I know gets good test scores (this is 3rd grade, and the whole school's ""rating"" depends on my 3rd grade scores). She put me in 3rd grade because of my good track record with scores (and more importantly, teaching struggling readers how to read), but now she's buzzing around me so much that I am freaking out.

At my other school I was always on the verge of a nervous breakdown, but this year at this new school I actually did have a nervous breakdown.  I had literally been getting 2 hours of sleep a night because I'm trying to please my new principal. Then I became suicidal and was in the psych ward because this pushed me over the edge.

Now I am so nervous when they come in my room, and really 24 hours a day, because I'm trying to conform to what they want me to do. 

How do people not get nervous about these kind of things? Other teachers just let it roll off their backs.  I am literally a nervous wreck and it's not good for me or my students."
1,"Unconscious harm? Hey everyone, just recently this happened again. The first time - that I can remember was at 15, I woke up with a burn on my arm(pretty bad burn) but had no memory of it happening - I was on no medication or alcoholic drinks or really anything at the time. Just recently it happened again - three years later- I woke up with scars on my arms - I have cut in the past but not in this place (also all my scars have faded away in and near the area) - only ones that have stayed are on my legs and that’s only two or three. I’ve been somewhat up and down mentally but in the past four - six months I’ve had a massive - majorly
Massive boost in mental well being (to the point where people can tell). I have no idea what to do and I can’t really hide them due to summer heat. "
1,"Sometimes I’m not sure whether I’m lying without realising. It’s difficult to explain but I guess my head is so foggy all the time that I’m not sure whether my memories are made up or not. This one time my mum told everyone that I tried to punch her and I don’t know if it was me or her who was lying. I’m also not sure whether I’m making up that I have BPD symptoms or not, I don’t even trust my own memory. It’s like I either have some kind of amnesia or trouble believing my own memories, or maybe I’m just struggling to see through the fog."
1,"It's not all about you? Whenever I'm venting to my mum, i'm usually crying, yelling, speaking with an angry tone or whatever and she'll say some suggestion and i answer with the same emotional charge i started the rant with and she always says ""why are you taking it out on me? ""Why are you speaking to me rudely?"" ""Stop yelling at me"" and it enrages me so much because i feel she is making it all about her and its fucking not its because im angry and upset and im not suddenly going to calm down just to answer her. I end up always yelling at her saying shit like ""Stop making it about you"" ""you think everything is about you"" etc and then we'll storm off.
Am i being selfish? I mean i definitely do get angry and feel she does make it about her when im trynna vent and yes i do reply rudley and aggressively but its because im upset and venting and cant just calm down to answer her and just get angrier the more she says that kinda stuff.
Does this happen to anyone else? Am i being inconsiderate? I feel what i feel but is it unreasonable? Am i in the wrong? Is this a bpd thing? Idk help "
1,"I spent about $600 at the bar on NYE and now I hate myself! Memories come in and out. As far as I know, it wasn't TOO embarrassing, and I was a super happy drunk. That money doesn't even include drinks other people were buying me. But I hate getting so drunk that there's gaps in my memory, and when I get that drunk I always end up feeling so full of shame and self hatred and anxiety the next day. Plus I'm broke. Fuuuuuckkkkk. 

Plus now I'm having another glass of wine! Luckily I don't get that drunk that often. Just needed to bitch a bit! Happy New Years y'all, I'm starting it off great over here. "
1,"having BPD is so tiring aside from the symptoms themselves, having to constantly analyze and correct my behavior is just so, so tiring.  it's exhausting to have to stuff my feelings back inside and remind myself that they aren't appropriate and they aren't based on reality.  I constantly feel myself sink deeper into a place that I know I shouldn't go and then have to drag myself out, only until the cycle repeats again."
1,"Don’t know what to do anymore Tired of being such a fuck up and having nobody around that can understand why besides a therapist I only see once a week. It just keeps getting worse. Days spent just numbing myself with anything I possibly can and no amount of drugs or self harm seem to do anything anymore at the same time yet I can’t stop this cycle of self destructing when part of me still wants to slowly kill myself. Why am I this fucked in the head? Sorry, if this makes no sense at all to anyone. I’m currently in tears due to my boyfriend basically blaming me for my BPD. He says I have no right to blame others but I DO blame myself more than anyone else for it. I guess somehow he just can’t see it. Is it really my fault that I have a disorder that literally makes me hate myself? I haven’t been able to eat all day. I feel sick. I can’t do anything. I just want to disappear and waste away. Happy fucking new year. Doubting I’ll make it to next year if this continues. I’ll probably regret making this post later and end up deleting it. I just don’t know what else to do anymore. "
1,"I want to be able to tell people about my BPD so they can understand the things I do but it's so humiliating I want to be able to tell my friends/acquaintances or people who follow me on social media that I act the way I do because of my BPD but I'm so embarrassed of it and feel like it's too taboo to talk about it. People don't really know what it is and they don't get it. I posted an article on Facebook about it today and deleted it a couple hours later because I just felt so uncomfortable. I'll get the urge to post on FB how sad I'm feeling during episodes or I'll spam my Snapchat with sad snaps and I just want to be able to say ""I'm sorry I'm like this, it's the BPD."" and have people just understand. Any time I use my BPD as an excuse for my actions to friends I feel so pathetic or embarrassed because I know they don't get it. "
1,"Help How do I help my FP see that he isn't hurting me and that I am beating myself up?? I've tried explaining it, I don't know what to do."
1,"Nothing looks familiar. Dissociation? How do I get out of this? The past 24 hours I haven't known where I'm at. I do but it feels like it isn't my stuff. I'm really numb so nothing seems to get my attention since I don't feel anything. The last thing I remember was arguing with my sister (an argument I started) and she was gas-lighting me pretty hard. And now I'm just numb and can't relate to anything. This has been happening a lot the last 6 months the last time 

I started thinking I was someone else and was convinced I was a Shaman and that crows and animals were trying to communicate with me. That lasted about all day and then it just whoosed away and then shame and embarrassment came over me along with fear because I didn't know why or how that happened. Can someone please give me some insight please? Happy new year all! Thanks. "
1,"There are some people that would like for you to accept that you are flawed; it fits their narrative. Don't let them pigeonhole you, they are simply doing this because it reduces the difficulty for them in dealing with you. It also has the very negative effect of making you feel like a piece of garbage, and worse, someone that is forever limited by their shortcomings.

What I have found, is that although BPD does come with its challenges, you are who you are. All of those complexities and possibly even malevolent thoughts are your strengths if you make them that, you must acknowledge the nasty parts of yourself in order to realize your full capacity. If you shove them down and hide from them, they only have more control over you, just how these people in your life would like it to be (not that they want you to suffer, but again, because you are diminished it simplifies their understanding of you). 

Edit: Your anecdotal experience has nothing to do with the fact this is a real thing that happens to people with disorders, people do categorize them. "
1,So many emotions I honestly really want to die. I always think that I’m never going to actually do it but I feel like I will soon. I’m losing health insurance. My car was totaled. Everybody just says that I shouldn’t complain because at least I don’t have cancer. And my therapist doesn’t understand. I have so much anger and emotions I’m seeing blurry. I want to end it now. I don’t even feel alive I feel like I’m fading in and out of reality. I asked my therapist for another screening well a new one to see if I have something else but no of course there is no need for a screening because I’m just looking for attention. I don’t thinking wanting to kill my self and others is normal. I don’t think hearing people and seeing weird things is normal. I’m so done with people and everybody not listening.
1,"I feel the BPD creeping back up on me...because I'm in a new/healthy relationship. [TW: Self-Harm] I'm in a brand new, secret relationship (we can't go public because of my crazy family). 

Things are like...too great. I'm almost tempted to self-harm because all of this positivity and sudden upheaval of him being home (he was in the military). 

Has anyone else been through this in a hot minute? I was in my ""sleeping-around"" phase for a while so my BPD died down for a while there and I was able to throw myself into my work.

Any positive vibes appreciated."

1,"Looking for some Options Hello,

I've decided to stop taking my medication 5 weeks ago. I was registered in my local hospital's outpatient program. The psychiatrist I was seeing would spare me ten minutes every two months. After he changed some medications and made me severely manic I had to defer quite a bit of school assignments and exams. I ended up in the hospital on exam day. 

I decided to be discharged from his care and seek another option, who was a severe downgrade from my original.

Now I'm out of options, and unmedicated. I finally have health insurance and I'm not too sure where to go from here. 

I couldn't attend the 8 month waiting list DBT program due to a class schedule conflict. I try my best to advocate for myself but I can tell that my mental health is very sporadic and I'm worried that I'll fail out of school. I live in ON, Canada.

I should also mention I have no recollection of the past few months...it just kind of happened, and it still just happening.

Thanks for your time."
1,"Could REALLY use some advice. Hey,

looking for some advice  on how others deal with this problem.

I just got back from England from a small vacation/time off and it was great I was with 6 friends there and I loved it, but I always have this issue where I don't appreciate it at the moment itself but always afterwards and I have this with pretty much everything in my life, iam so scared im going have this at my deathbed. My life is great, I got a loving family, pretty good friends and a nice job and yet I dont appreciate it as I should and the worst thing is. I know of the problem and yet I got no clue on how to solve it. Also I have this stupid retarded issue in my head where I can't buy anything nice for myself or the people closes to me but I can buy something nice and really expensive for someone meh/I barely see or are not that close to me and again I know of it but I don't know how to deal with it.

Also I have no Idea who I actually am, im really into politics and history and im pretty conservative and complain alot about the current state of society  and yet. I had in total 7 escorts come over, and 2 of them I developed feelings for within a F**king hour. What is wrong with me. Worst thing is I dont even know why im doing it cause I don't even enjoy the sex or anything. I have this really big hatred/dislike for hypocrisie and yet I seem to be the BIGGEST one.

When I was in England, a friend of mine her Niece picked us up and sometimes hang out with us. She is a very friendly sweet girl but I know she is nothing for me but everytime I fall inlove/get feelings for her BUT! Again I know she is NO match for me and I still fall in love I feel like im not in control at all. 

I cut myself on my arm and although I do it to keep myself sane, I keep finding myself positioning my cuts in such a way that they are not very visible but still visible enough to notice(only when I want to/certain people). In the hope someone sees them and helps me out, I think this is a disguisting trait of myself and again I know of it but keep doing it. 

Also I find my self image to be very changing, one moment I look at myself and think well okay thats okay/could be worse. And other times im completely disgusted by myself and truly hate how I look, I cant even look in mirrors sometimes. 

I also know I need to take action to actually try and get a girl yet im extremely passive and have no idea how to talk to women in a not just friends way, im also super super blind to flirting. Alot of times I hear friends say dude she was flirting with you and I honestly had no Idea at all, I just see someone acting friendly. Again I complain to friends that I miss a girl who is their for me and I know the problem yet I dont do anything about it. 

I have no damn clue who I am and where the hell I stand for, I have really strong opinions on things and yet I find myself betraying my own morales. 

I just have no idea how to express it, I can seriously cry my eyes out and go freaking mental and lets say that in the middle of that A friend comes by and asks how you doing in a sincere way I cant bring myself to say it. Even If i want to I just CANT get the words out.

Why can't I just tell my parents they are amazing and that I love them, but why CAN I tell a female (just a friend) who helped me out once. Why can I text her a bible text that Im thankful and that I pretty much swear my allegiance to her. Again Im aware but I dont know how to fix it.

One moment depressed and one moment the party maker, and no I have not seeked for help yet cause every time I did I cant seem to express myself or finding myself able to not be honest/cant get the mask off. 

I think im losing my mind and im so sorry if this text is a complete mess but Its very rare for me to actually express/write down how I feel, if you have any advice I would be super thankful.

If you have any questions feel free to ask, sorry for the grammar and sorry if its very dramatic but I honestly have no other way to describe it. 

For the record I'm 22 Male. 

Thank you all so much, even if youre only reading this. "
1,"I wonder if I'd feel lonely even in the afterlife? I'm so lonely. I'm absolutely terrified of reaching out and asking for any kind of human contact, wether it'd be a hug from my mom or asking a girl I met on tinder to meet up. 
I don't talk to any people regularly except for my mom who I live with. Nobody gives me any attention and I'm about to loose my shit. My only friend's on the other side of the globe right now. I have nobody, I might as well just kill myself. Nobody's ever going to love me or validate me, or give me the attention I need. And that's all because of me. Because I'm terrified of other people. I can't even talk to my therapists about my loneliness, because I'm afraid they'll find me clingy, or annoying, or whatever. Doesn't matter. I wish I was dead."

1,"Recently diagnosed I was diagnosed with BPD two and a half weeks ago. Shortly after I found this subreddit and have been mostly lurking. I've been looking back through my life through social media and it is so crazy to see how obvious my manic and depressive episodes are.

Hello ☺️👋"
1,"Are SO's treated differently? I hope this is the correct sub for this question.

Looking back at my recently ended long term relationship with my BPD ex-girlfriend has given me some questions.  She ended things about 30 days ago but has since started cautiously talking to me again.  That part isn't my question. 

My question.  From what I've been able to see and from watching her reactions with friends, family and her children.  It seems I was the target of the brunt of her anger.  She would  misinterpret a simple comment or anything I said that she took as criticism and would become very angry, and hurt.  Even repeated attempts to explain what I meant never worked.  She would seem stuck on the initial comment.  I've never seen her do that to any other person.   

Example:. What caused our break up of 8 years.  She was telling me how tired she was.  I validated her comments by telling her anyone would be exhausted doing all the things you've been dining.  Then I added. A good night's sleep can do wonders. She blew up despite my attempts to say it was a comment made because I cared and understood she was tired.  The next day she sent me a text.  I'm not happy with you or this relationship since the beginning.  I'm done.  End of text.  Blocked on all social media and everything else.

Is it common to lash out and be more critical of your SO?  To pay more attention to everything they say?

1,"BPD Siblings...can’t get along?? Hi Everyone,

So I’m a diagnosed BPD’er and my brother is (what I believe) is an undiagnosed person with BPD. 

We can’t seem to get along. And with my Mom being so sick he will be the only family that I have left. Just an FYI...he lives in the upstairs suite with his family and I live in the downstairs suite with the Mom, who I take care of. 

It seems that he is unable to give any amount of empathy in any situation. When discussing anything to do with feelings...he comes across as cold and distant...either that or inappropriately angry to the point of rage.  This is in direct contrast to myself, who is overly empathetic and quite often likes to discuss feelings. (Maybe this is also a bit of a gender thing??). 

I have been noticing that I split on him every week or so over something he says or does/doesn’t do. From my point of view he doesn’t care if he has any type of relationship with me at all...which hurts. 

Is there a different way I can go about this?? He will not get help...doesn’t believe he has issues and doesn’t believe in mental health treatment. So...I guess the onus is on me to change. I want so bad to connect with him as he will be my only remaining family but I have no idea how to get along with him. 

I know I’ve read some of your posts about being unable to be empathetic...I guess I really have a hard time understanding this. 

I’m rambling now. Any comments, thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!

Thanks!!"
1,"I shared my story and something wonderful happened. Would you mind sharing your story? I'm cross-posting this from /r/BipolarReddit because BPD was not yet ruled out (diagnosed with Bipolar 1). But this subreddit and the other have been incredibly helpful for me in coping, and the relationship challenges addressed here are something that continue to hit very close to home.

December was a very difficult month for me, and this subreddit became a sanctuary during some especially hard moments. So first of all - thank you to all of you. You have helped me to realize I am not alone in this.

As a sort of therapy for myself, I shared a video of my recent challenges on Facebook. I felt completely vulnerable and almost removed it. But then responses of love and encouragement began pouring in. It was empowering and brought me a sense of hope I haven't had in a while.

People from all parts of my life began private messaging me, sharing their own stories of mental health challenges.

I realized that talking openly about my challenges is very helpful to me in the start of the journey to management. I invite you to [hear my story](https://www.facebook.com/tommygeoco/posts/10212173351023813?pnref=story) and share your own story in the comments below.

What kind of challenges are you currently facing? How far have you come? What are you suffering from right now?

I begin a DBT partial in-patient program on January 16th, and I'm trying to make it through every day leading up to that date.

Thank you again for everything this subreddit has provided in allowing me to pursue self-love and a sense of peace. It's a long road, I'm told, but today I feel present and capable.

Side note: I've been listening and re-listening to an audiobook called [Calming the Emotional Storm](https://www.audible.com/pd/Self-Development/Calming-the-Emotional-Storm-Audiobook/B01AH7EERA) in place of music lately, and just listening to the voice of the narrator and practicing a coping method here and there has been tremendously helpful for me. I hope it offers some calm to one of you."
1,"Does anyone have any uplifting thoughts or moments they would like to share? Maybe some difficulty you thought you would never overcome but did, or feeling you thought would never go away but you have moved past and what helped you? I’m sitting in my new therapists office, about a half hour early. Last therapist I met with referred me to her within 15 mins of talking to me because she wanted me to see someone who specifically offered DBT. I am excited but also incredibly nervous and scared. I’m in one of those moods where you feel like you’re a normal person and previous overreactions/suicidality was just you being dramatic and that you have control and see that now.

 I know this is fleeting. I can go from feeling completely sane and in control to spiraling quickly in my head from something as simple as reading a text message and interpreting it wrong. Sometimes it’s hard because I don’t know what I would tell a therapist because I often forget how strong my feelings were the other day, or how much I cried and the strange things I said. 

They all seem so distant even if it’s just been a few days so when I am asked how I’m doing or what’s been going on I sort of blank.. anyway sorry for rambling on, I am just looking for some inspiration to help see that changing habits is possible and what other people have found most helpful in their lives."
1,"I'm going back to therapy soon and I'm wondering whether or not to tell the new therapist I think I might have BPD? I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety (generalized and social) about five years ago now, but I think BPD might better explain some of my symptoms. I was under 18 when I was diagnosed with those things, so I couldn't have been diagnosed with BPD even if the psychologist suspected it. Anyway. I've been doing a lot of research (I know that's not always great, but... idk) and BPD does seem to fit. I don't know if it's best to tell her what I think or let her reach the conclusion herself. The problem is, therapy is expensive, and I'd like to start making progress as soon as possible. So I don't want to waste months waiting for her to reach a conclusion I could be giving her now. I also worry that, if I tell her I think it's BPD, she might decide it isn't just because I've said it is and she wants to be the one to come up with the answer herself. If that makes sense. Idk if she'd do that or not; I've never met her. Alternatively, I might not have BPD at all. But I'd rather know that for sure. 


Do any of you have experience with this? Any advice about how to proceed? Should I go to the first session and gage the situation and then maybe tell her in the second one instead? 


I should note that I'm not *trying* to be diagnosed with BPD. I think it might explain some things about me, but it's fine with me if I don't actually have it. I just want to know so I can either move on or deal with it accordingly. 


Thanks :) "
1,"No Relationships = Progress? I just realized the only time I've ever made any progress with my behavioural/identity/self-esteem issues is when I cut off contact with almost everyone in my life. I talked to my Dad and people at work but, other than that, it was very minimal contact. I found I was really coming into myself. It was when I started reintroducing relationships and sharing feelings with others that I crumbled ten times harder than before. It almost makes me wonder if I'd be happier on my own with just my family. Any thoughts or similar experiences? 

I need to add that this isn't a negative post. I was truly happy when I was alone. For the first time ever. I appreciate any feedback! :) hope you're all well."
1,"sorry Honestly, I cannot bear to read any of the posts here because everything is so... everything. its all too spot on, all too real, all too overwhelming, everything. 

I just recently got diagnosed with BPD. lol is diagnosed even the proper term for this? 

I don't know what to do, and even if I see a ""happy result/ending"" here, I know it won't necessarily apply to me. And if its a bad one, then that doesn't help. And saying that it'll get better or keep your head up, or keep going or that someone else will come around, or anything at all, will not help. 

so honestly there is no point in me really posting this but I don't really know coz here I am anyway.

1,"Socialization with a former friend Today I will be forced to socialize briefly (I hope) with a former friend. I'm still quite bitter about the way things went down. My anxiety is currently through the roof. 

I don't know if I can do this. 😔😔😔"
1,"how can I help my boyfriend when he is splitting? Hi guys,

my boyfriend has BPD. We've been together for a year. He sometimes splits on me and I use validation and empathy to talk through the issue. It works quite well but leaves me emotionally drained as I have to ignore the hurtful things he says to me. I was wondering whether you had any specific tips for loved ones when you are splitting on them, things that work in calming you down/seeing that you're splitting.

He's not in therapy unfortunately so he does not recognise his behaviour until afterwards (sometimes) and he then feels like shit. I've given up trying to get him to go as it creates conflict. He knows he has a problem  and he wants to change but he's very wary of therapists. I feel like at one point I'm gonna be too exhausted to continue.

Any help welcome."
1,"pushing all romantic relationships away? I don’t know why, but literally every single time I start talking to someone, I always get unattracted to them as soon as they catch feelings for me. It’s like I’m only in it for the chase. I really want a relationship, but I can’t control it at all. Even if it’s someone way out of my league, when they catch feelings for me, I stop liking them completely. I flirt with them, do anything for their attention, then once they give it to me, I just don’t want to talk to them anymore. Is that only me or do other people have this problem?"
1,"I hate being called ""crazy"" I'm not crazy and I hate when people tell me I am. It's so demeaning it just hurts me. I have a lot of problems sure, but it's not craziness.... IDK I wish people would stop saying that. I care alot I just don't know how to show it."

1,"crush help so i've had this off and on crush on a long distance friend... 

they know about my issues, and they know i've been crushing on them. they have made it VERY CLEAR that they will not tolerate anything negative. i'm so scared of making them dislike me i just withdraw and hide my pain. i know i'm not their responisibility but it still hurts.  

like a week before i was hospitalized, i asked them if i ever do anything that annoys them (BAD DECISION) and they said i send way too many messages while they are at work and they can't focus. of course the air raid sirens started going off in my head and i started burning bridges and self destructing. i apologized to them after my hospitalization (not related to them) and they were really angry and said i should be apologizing to myself. i stayed very distant to them for the past 3 weeks. i assumed they didn't like me anymore.  

anyway... they started talking to me again. they've just had an operation and have been recovering. they've been flirting with me. i just feel complete ecstasy talking with them. i was um ^^pleasuring myself the other day and they said they like when i'm being ""kind"" to myself because i deserve to feel happy... a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a stop please i can't distance myself if i love you . it's long distance. i need someone i can physically be with.. I'M SO TORN. UGH. i getting attached to them again and thinking about it more is giving me anxiety. i want it to get closer. i want it so bad. but it's not an option. how do i stop it without just cutting them out completely?  

i'm currently in a really good mood. i only got 3 hours of sleep but i'm feeling ok. i'm getting stressed out talking to them. why couldn't they stay distant. i worked so hard to make myself alone and miserable. "
1,"Fuck Birthdays! UGH! [Venting] Does anyone else feel this way? I've always fucking despised that day - it's like everyone around you wants to fucking make it special and I'm just like - LEAVE ME ALONE. I DON'T WANT TO FUCKING ""CELEBRATE"" THIS DAY COZ I DONT FUCKING LIKE MYSELF ANYWAYS.

Ugh and then I spiral in my head thinking, fuck, others will feel bad. So I pretend and ""let"" them celebrate - all the time in my head constantly splitting but putting up with it. 

Birthdays, in a weird way, because of above, ends up being the most exhaustive fucking day of the year for me. 

FUCKING HELL! JUST LEAVE ME ALONE PLEASE - AT LEAST ON THAT DAY. 

I'M NOTHING SPECIAL. STOP FUCKING TRYING TO ""BE"" WITH ME OR ""DO"" THINGS FOR ME ON THAT DAY. STOP MAKING THAT DAY A BIG DEAL. 

FUCKKKKK!

Sorry... couldn't help but vent :(

I just want to cry right now. Like BAWL MY EYES OUT CRY!

BTW, it's not my birthday today. It's around the corner and everyone already asking about spending time with me. FUCK!

I'm gonna fucking lie to everyone and just disappear. 

Then wallow the rest of the year for hurting them by not being there for them on my fucking birthday.

FUCK THESE EXTREMES. I CANNOT EVEN.... :( :( :("
1,"Anybody else think others’ happiness is directly correlated with your unhappiness? 2017 was a shitty year for me. I got divorced, went broke, been drunk for pretty much months on end, and have gone downhill professionally. On the other hand, three of my girlfriends who have struggled with infertility for 3+ years got pregnant, my mentor got married, my closest friend finally has a super healthy relationship, my brother is pursuing his dream of law school...I’ve noticed for years that anytime things are going well for me they’re going awful for everyone else and vice versa. Maybe it’s worth it for my life to be shitty so the people around me are happy, but it doesn’t keep me from being frustrated."
1,"Should I file a police report against my bf who raped and physically abused me? I have bpd. I'm going through counseling for it and realized through my healing that my boyfriend abuses me.

He's sent me in the hospital after I tried to hurt myself and when I told him the doctors said I needed to be with someone after I left, he accused me of lying and being manipulative. He then asked for money for me traumatizing him through my self harm. He wanted Over $600 for his services.

I've been with him for about 1/2 a year and there have been multiple times he's had sex with me without my consent.

The most recent time was less than 72 hours ago. I realize that if I file the police report and they need evidence, I need to file it within that time frame.

I'm not sure what the effects of this will be for me. I'm scared that if I don't he will continue to think it's accent behavior. I'm also afraid if I don't I'll just continue accepting him walking over me.

What should I do?"
1,"I always feel abandoned and it's so tiring I'm in somewhat of a long distance relationship and I keep looking for signs of rejection, and any small thing makes me feel devalued, unloved, humiliated and abandoned. It’s like I need constant fucking reassurance and appreciation, and it’s getting so tiring. He has not been talking to me as often as before, and I know it’s mostly because he is going through a bad period, but I can barely focus on anything else. I want to ask him if he loves me or cares about me, and I want to say that sometimes I feel like dying even though I don’t *really*, because I have things I look forward to in the future but the present has been so empty for a long time now. I just want to hear that I matter because I just don’t feel like I do. 

He met a lot of his friends recently and I kept feeling that they were probably much better than me, and that I don’t matter anymore at all once I’m not the only one around. I have a really hard time accepting that being happy with others and not being physically around me doesn't automatically mean that he doesn't care anymore. It’s so incredibly selfish but I really wish I was the only one that could make him truly happy, because that would be something certain and I could stop worrying about whether I’m still enough. 


I hate that I see abandonment in everything. A couple of days ago I said I missed him and he didn’t say he missed me too. I’m in pain for days and if not that, I feel empty and unneeded, and I just think about the future because I made sure I’ll have something to look forward to. But I really don’t want to depend on anyone, because that feels weak and I don’t want to lose control in that sense. I want to be happy about happiness that doesn’t involve me, I don’t want to read things into everything. I don’t want to rely on outside sources for being content. Words of appreciation will make me feel an emotional high, then it’s destroyed the same day by some minor thing which most often is meaningless.

1,"DAE experience this? When I get into a confrontation with another person, especially if it's someone close to me, I usually start saying tons of stuff than I end uo forgetting when I calm down. 

It's kind of like a Jekyll and Hyde situation. Lat time it happened was around 2 weeks ago during a trip with my friends. I got into a tiff with my best friend, and the next thing I remember was her saying she wante to get away from me. Everything I said in those 30 seconds (it was a really short yet impetuous fight) completely vanished off my mind. 

What does this mean? Am I splitting? I really wish it could stop since that led me to having no friends, and I would like to prevent it next time I feel it coming."
1,"Dealing with extreme emotions Really tired of this feeling all emotions to the extreme thing. I just did an exam that I thought was going to be TERRIBLE, but it wasn’t (I think). Now, I’m at an equally terrible high. I’m scared that if I didn’t do well in the exam, this is all gonna come crashing down and it’ll suck worse than the good feeling high right now. 

What are some ways you deal with extreme emotions? I am aware that all of this may turn out the way I don’t want it to, but I know emotionally I can never be prepared for when it happens, and either I will feel the pain very very hard, or I will go numb. Based on personal experience, I’ve found it’s usually the latter. "
1,"who else struggles with excessive daydreaming to the point where you can't connect with the outside world? Ive always been a very vivid daydreamer, especially as a kid. Back then i could read a few pages of a book, get inspired and then create an intricate inner world in my mind and run with it from there. I struggled a lot as a kid to fit in from kindergarten to high school, i found it hard to make friends and socialise. There was a good deal of bullying and rejection as well. I've always retreated into my own mind, however now at 22 I find its becoming hard to stay connected to the  rest of the world.
I more often than not feel like theres a glass wall between me and other people. On top of that i have a general ambivalence towards others, i find the conversations in my head fulfilling and real enough that i don't care about making an effort with other people. I find myself often getting lost in my daydreams, I know the difference between fantasy and real life but it feels like i get stuck inside myself. At work I'm friendly and sociable enough with new people and make an effort, however soon find myself not caring and i slowly stop talking to them. If i do socialise with people i feel I'm instantly very janky and awkward, which I'm assuming forces me to retreat further. Often I can barely wait for work or uni to be over so I can be by myself, ill talk to other people if I'm particularly desperate and trying to make time fly by but thats about it. 
I've also dissociated severely in the past but i don't think thats part of this issue. 

I had so many other thoughts I was going to jot down but they're escaping me right now, I guess what i'm trying to find out is if anyone else has had similar experience."
1,"DAE avoid their bedroom out of anxiety? My anxiety kicks up at night, particularly the later it gets, when bedtime draws near. I have anxiety during the day too, but I'm usually able to overcome it by focusing on something. At night, however, I'm prone to this kind of anxiety that makes me avoid my bedroom... I feel more comfortable/at ease/distracted by being on the couch, and I'll usually mindlessly browse facebook or watch infomercials until I can't keep my eyes open anymore and pass out (note I say ""passing out"" because I can't make the conscious decision to just ""go to sleep""). Some nights the anxiety is so bad that I don't pass out, and am forced to go to work the next morning on literally zero sleep. I don't understand it and neither does my psychologist. I can't take it. I'm so exhausted and worn down. I want to understand it so bad so I can start to work on it and overcome it, but even google isn't yielding any relevant results...

Thoughts? Advice? Literally ANYTHING...?"
1,"Does anyone else have this problem in relationships? Have any of you ever had an SO tell you ""It's hard for you to see how much I love you when you don't love yourself,"" or that ""I wish you could see what I see,"" since your self-image is poor?

I really feel like my self-criticism and self-hatred take a toll on my perception and strain my relationship.  I think my boyfriend used to think he could fix it, but the problem is really within myself.  Now I don't know if it's ever going to be fixed.

Has anyone heard of something similar to those statements from their SO or know what I'm talking about?  I feel like it's sort of a BPD issue relating back to feelings of worthlessness."
1,"Getting away from it all I always thought i just had a lot of anxiety combined with really poor copong skills, and that was why i hated school even though i was so good at it. I recenty found out i have bpd, and a lot more stuff is starting to make sense. I just want to escape, i dont fit in and i dont want to. I like myself the way i am, but if im the one with the problem, then i should be the one to separate myself from society to releive the burden i put on everyone else, as well as the guilt i face myself. I dont want to live like this, but escaping this way of life seems mead impossible. I have no money and a high school diploma, im paralyzed with the fear of making the wrong chioce, or ending up in another situation i hate. "
1,"Anyone in Melbourne? I heard of a monthly meet up for people with BPD and BP in Melbourne but can't find any recent info about it. With this in mind (and the assumption that it's been discontinued) would anyone be interested in setting up something similar? I really need to feel like I'm doing some proactive to understand and aid my recovery, and I've never met anyone in real life with BPD. 

Would anyone be interested, or does anyone know of any resources in Melbourne I might have missed? Cheers in advance :)

Edit: should have made it clear I'm looking in Melbourne, Australia "
1,"I feel like BPD is making me ether insane or a really cold person. I guess there's an inbetween where I'm sitting at currently but as far as the future? I don't know. 
It's becoming easier to snap on people, to be hateful, to cut people out without thinking about it. I blow up a lot, I have the strength to at least do half of it in private. 

I just feel crazier every second of the day. I'm a ticking time bomb, I'm just waiting for someone to do something little. 
I hate everybody because of how much I hate myself and I've been letting that takeover so I'm just a different person every day. 
Sometimes I feel like I'm shaking myself by the shoulders, just when it's really, really bad. When I'm using a weight to try to break my arm. I twitch, talk to myself, I calm down very slowly. 

I'm so mean to everyone and I don't want anyone around me and I can't stay in a room by myself. Every day it's a new hell. I think I'm managing because I'm turning into someone else. A functional, manipulative, aggressive mess. 

I feel bad for my new therapist. "
1,"I've spent 3 months searching for a therapist and realized there is no help for me. I've been searching for a therapist for 3 months now. I have 3 criteria. In my insurance, does DBT, Specializes in Borderline. 

I put in the filter for my insurance since I don't have $100+/week to spend and instantly I'm knocked down to around 20 people. 

Then I put in DBT and i get literally zero results. I don't even get to put in the borderline filter and I get shut down. 

What the fuck am I supposed to do? My insurance is free as it's paid for by the state which is nice because I don't have a job and can't afford any other insurance but they don't cover seemingly any therapists and I can't change because I can't afford it but I can't afford to go without either. 

How am I supposed to get help or get better if I have shit insurance and no money? I'm just lost, I really don't know what to do. "
1,"Is this abuse. I hate this. My mother and step fathers household was filled with strangeness. They would talk in the open about their sex life, though they acted like they were being sneaky  

My mother would comment on my hair, makeup, perfume, telling me I looked like a hooker. She would also ask me what I thought of the models in magazines or on lingerie ads; all when I was very young.

I soon learned that my stepfather loved dressing up in women’s clothing. They also kept their porn collection easy to find. 

My stepfather would always comment on me and my sisters body and how we were developing.
He would also take digital photos of us at the pool, all in front of my mother. He would also walk through my room while I was showering, as my bathroom was attached to my room. 

My mother was a narcissist. She would steal money from me and always stuck by her husbands. 

My step father soon progressed into sneaking into me and my sisters room while we were sleeping. I woke up once to him taking a photo of me in bed in the middle of the night. I also once heard him under my bed and in my closet. Once we found photos from up my sisters dress on his phone. He would sneak photos of me from up my skirt while driving me to school, pretty obviously but I was scared because I was young. I also saw that he googled “sex with step daughters” on his computer. 

He would keep guns in the house and I was always scared of dying. 

We told our mom but she didn’t believe us. She made up excuses for everything. We broke contact with her after a while but he still has an eleven year old daughter. 

I’m fucked up from this. I have nightmares and feel danger all the time. I have no trust and hate sex. I am on mood stabilizers and am in therapy. Fuck this. "

1,"I spent 2017 digging myself into isolation :( I feel so ashamed of 2017. It was truly the worst year of my life, I was extremely suicidal every single day of it. The only reason I’m still here is because I keep hoping things will get better when I’m the one who fucked up my life.

After graduating high school I just got sadder and sadder, I was free from seeing people who had badly hurt me in class everyday, but I no longer got to see the friends and teachers I loved everyday. Without mandatory classes where we saw each other, everyone got too busy and my friend group only gets together once every couple weeks now. I felt abandoned, tried to keep busy by working on art and trying to get a job, but after a couple applications led to no interviews I guess I just gave up.

I’m 19, still living with my parents, with no drivers license, no job and very little job experience to get one. I’m trying to sign up for community college for this semester but I’m pretty damn sure it’s way too late to get into any classes. I didn’t even plan on living this long, I sure as hell never planned on college. I don’t know how to do anything. When I do rarely see my friends and everyone asks what I’ve been up to, I’m too ashamed to say that I’m alone in my room nearly everyday.

I want to get my license and I finished the online course, but my parents are always too busy to help me practice driving, and I get frustrated when I do practice because we don’t get along, so it gets really stressful and I just end up coming home in tears of sadness or rage. Signing up for classes has been taking so much longer and has so many more steps than I thought it would. I feel so stupid for not doing this earlier and for not being prepared or knowing how to do this. It’s probably pointless and I feel like the college is just gonna laugh at me for trying to get in this semester when it’s about to start! And I feel like I can’t apply for a job again until I know for sure if I’ll be in community college so that I know what hours I can work.

I wanna stop being a failure and get something done, but I feel so overwhelmed by everything that I haven’t done and need to do, I just spend most of my time stress-crying, unfairly lashing out at everyone, and still not doing anything important. I don’t want to be this pathetic child anymore but it feels like there’s no way out. My biggest fear is that 2018 is gonna turn into another 2017 :("

Even if we are apart for the day. 
Even if Ive had the day off and have to go to work the next day I don't sleep and it intensifies. It's not like I don't trust  what he's doing, I trust he wouldn't cheat or anything. We text through the day.

I got injured and if we get injured, we immediately have to go to urgent care and get checked out,  as well as drug tested. Its the only job out of the 15+ I've had in my working life that I didn't totally hate. Some days,  yeah,  I did. But overall, I got to work with animals and I liked that. It took me months and moving across the country to get it. My work history is total shit. I tend to only get jobs that have a high turnover rate. The job I just lost did have a high turnover rate. But I liked it nonetheless. I'm not going to find another job that pays well enough to support me. Granted, it barely did, but it was income. My landlord is already not too keen with me as far as payments,  so if she finds out I'm unemployed,  that won't be good. I'm already behind on everything else Im supposed to pay monthly.

1,"Desperately seeking relationship advice I need some help, insight, suggestions, advice, anything. I have been with my significant other for 5+ years, and he has been there for me through everything. So many breakdowns, addictions, tears, mood swings, everything.

But I still love him dearly, if that makes any sense. He is a very, very good person and would be a wonderful life partner. Here’s the dilemma: I recently met someone else and began to have serious feelings for this other person. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to cheat on my significant other (and haven’t) but I feel like emotionally I’ve already cheated. I am scared to break up with him because of our long history together. It would just seem like such a waste of everything we fought for together. I would lose my best friend. But I also don’t want to let this other person go.

1,"Splitting - in need of tips/tricks Hello all -



My splitting is officially at an all time worst. I can have an incredibly satisfying day, but at the wrong time, someone or some thing might send my mind off on its own, and it’s very hard to handle &amp; deal with in stride, without projecting onto anybody.




I’m in the middle of a few legal issues that are keeping me off-Center, so perhaps my BPD/splitting is as wonky as it ever has been because of that, but nonetheless, I would appreciate any and all advice related to keeping the splitting as tame and manageable as possible.

1,"money, lies, boyfriend, fml I'm going fucking crazy. I feel like dying and I feel like a huge fuck up and an idiot, worthless.

So my boyfriend helped me pay my college tuition (I had to go back to finish up a grad certificate to become a licensed counselor) and I got reimbursement from work. So he paid it and I was just going to pay him back with my reimbursement. I didn't get the full amount, so I was like, well I'll just pay him back with part of my money. I didn't tell him I didn't get the full amount, either. Because I was like, I will figure it out.

It took a while to get the reimbursement, too. I finally did and sent up the transfer, than cancelled it because I needed the money for bills. And I didn't tell him. I just lied and said that I set up the transfer and it should have gone through. I was planning on doing this until my next payday. Then just pay him. And not say anything. Well today he was like, show me your checking account, why hasn't it gone through, etc etc? I ended up telling him the truth. He was rightfully pissed off. Like, I lied. He said he didn't care about the money and he wished I just told him because he would have just let me have the money. He's more upset because I didn't tell him the truth. Again, I get.

I was crying and I apologized and I told him I would pay him back and I acknowledged I lied and how fucked up it was and that he didn't deserve that and that I shouldn't have done it. He said it didn't matter why I did it, but that I did it, and that now he can't trust anything I say or do or have said or done in the past. Related to everything. 

We have had money arguments before. We don't live together, though. He just tells me to tell him when I need help, but I don't want to make my stupid fucking money problems his. So I don't tell him everything going on. I have been able to figure it out mostly. And sometimes I have really bad, desperate months, sadly. But I HATE telling him. Plus he's made comments like, ""how come you have no money?"" I'm a single mom and all my money goes to bills! I have very little spending money. He has two roommates and makes way more money than me. Plus I've been in poverty most of my life, while raising my kid. I make okay/decent money now, but I have a lot of debt. I even brought up having a roommate to him in the past and he is so against it. And I don't know why. But he doesn't want to live with me because I have a kid and because of my rabbits. 

I don't know why I lied. Well ... I am embarrassed as fuck and ashamed about my money situation. I try so fucking hard. And I thought I could pay him without him realizing what actually happened. I realized me lying made it way fucking worse and was fucked up. I feel so bad. 

He left my apartment and walked home. I haven't contacted him. But he said he's not sure what to do about this because he says he cannot trust me at all anymore. I feel like shit. Absolute shit. I want to die. I have been laying in my bed, crying, feel so fucking down. I really fucking love him. It sucks so much. I'm not going to contact him until he contacts me. :( FML.

help! What should I do? I just want to die. Like, dying would be so much easier than dealing with all of this. "
1,"To tell or not to tell ? So a girl who I've gotten close to exhibits all of the signs of BPD. I know because I've dated a girl with BPD before and I have psychiatrist relatives (I'm not a professional myself but have done a large amount of reading into the subject) 

She's currently cut all contact with me, 2 days after we admitted our feelings for each other. This is not the first time she's gone completely quiet, but it is the longest. 

She's not mentioned to me that she has BPD, but has opened about other issues.

I care for her deeply and want her to be happy. The thought of her sad and alone makes me incredibly sad. 

I think a major part of her improving her life would be to receive some DBT.

But, how should I tell her what I suspect? Can I tell her?

I was exhausted and thought it would be worth it but it wasn't and I'm still working as many days . I hate the entire job it's not for me . I have no other choice because I have nothing else at the moment but I'm miserable there .

I know it's because of my bpd ..but i don't even get a break for 8 hour shifts .. I need a job from home ..someone please help .. 😢"
1,"Boyfriend wanted some space today For the past few days my home situation(and probably by extension, my crazy ass) has been stressing my boyfriend out and he said he wanted some me time today(of course I freaked out and thought this meant BREAK UP TIME YALL) and honestly not talking to him made me want to kill myself, now he wants to play a game with me and it surprises me because I thought he really was done with my ass for the day he's been responding differently in our chats I thought he was annoyed with me 

I took my meds but I still think he hates me or his parents(bless their soul they're just concerned for his wellbeing and what my awful family's actions are doing to his health) hate me too , I can't see past that

hnnnngh I just needed to get that out somewhere "

1,"Link between BPD symptoms and Problematic Facebook Use: the role of emotion regulation, shame, anger, rejection sensitivity Hi, I am a Clinical Psychologist in Training completing my Doctoral thesis on the above topic. I am a DBT therapist and have worked clinically with many people with BPD. I found that facebook use could sometimes exasperate symptoms of BPD and found it to be a real problem  clinically, but very little research conducted into this important area. I would be so grateful if anyone here who has a diagnosis of BPD or feels they meet the criteria for BPD would consider completing this short online study (approx 15 mins). Thanks so much, Denise.

1,"I have BPD and It's ruining my relationship with my boyfriend of almost 2 years Recently has been very rough for me. Cause of the Holidays, family gatherings etc. It's been alot to handle. I have been mentally abused by my family for almost all my life. My parents never liked me as much as they like my siblings which was fine. I was never really as great as them. I accepted and tried to do better. As time passes nothing really changed just My depression and anxiety got worse and worse. I introverted myself from everything. I refuse to go out, hang out with anyone or be vocal about what I'm feeling. I feel like they'll judge me and possibly end our relationship/friendship. 

Self harm isn't a new thing for me. But I have been clean for almost 3 months until new years eve came. I couldn't handle it anymore and just did it. I was so disappointed at myself and I knew my boyfriend would not like it. My boyfriend doesn't have BPD so he doesn't quite understand my struggles. Which I do not blame him for it. We've been arguing so much for the past months and I knew that I was the cause of the arguments. I am very selfish and didn't think what he would think. I said that I cut again to him and he didn't like it of course. I know I should have said something before doing it. But He was with his family enjoying and didn't want to ruin the holiday for him.

Now I'm just lost. He tries to understand me. He does research about my mental illness but it's just me dragging him down when I know I should let go. He deserves someone better and Would be much happier than he is with me. "
1,"How to talk to SO about bpd? So last night I tried to talk to my girlfriend about my bpd, because I've never really had a great time to bring it up or I would get too nervous that she'd leave if I told her. When I tried to explain what it was I think she took my nervousness for not wanting to talk about it; She told me that she doesn't believe that people are their mental illnesses. Which is nice and I know that she doesn't particularly like talking about her own mental health, but I feel like the longer I don't explain to her what bpd is the more I'm tricking her or lying to her about who I really am.

I just really dont know how to bring it up again and like explain that it's important"
1,Has anyone been misdiagnosed before? I have been reading all of the stories and I can relate to pretty much everything that has been said about borderline personality syndrome. I recently talked with my psychiatrist about it and she said she doesn't believe I have it. It seemed like I triggered something when I brought it up though. Later she told me that her step mother had BPD and she was the reason that she got into psychiatry. She said that everyone has the same symptoms and there is no deviation. I speculate she believes this because of the trauma from her step mother but I'm not I can't make that judgement. I have read that you can change BPD it's just very difficult to do so. Has anyone ever had any similar experience with a psychiatrist? I'm desperate to figure out what is going on with my life. 
1,do you ever think about stuff that could happen and get a lot of anxiety about it? just thought of something that may or may not happen and i’m on the verge of a panic attack and thinking of ways to get out of it. what the actual fuck
1,"New casual relationship, BEEP BEEP here come the feelings A friend I’ve known for a bit recently asked if I would be interested in some casual stuff with him and I said yes, because he’s a really cool dude who is also super hot.

I haven’t been in a real relationship for almost two years now, but I’ve had lots of casual relationships since then and avoiding feelings always feels like a big ordeal. This one I feel would be more embarrassing than any of the other ones because I’ve been friends with this guy, whereas I met the other ones on tinder. 

Tinder guys that I like make it easy to get over feelings for them.  I have terrible taste and they show me that they are mean and selfish on like the first date usually so I’m safe. So it sucks in a weird way that this new dude is really really nice and caring. I sleep over, he makes me coffee, we watch videos or just talk for hours. It feels sooooooo nice and that is when the kill bill sirens go off in the back of my brain. Like “uh oh. Danger danger intimacy ahead danger danger” which might be why I am drawn to dudes I hate. No risk of intimacy. 

Not really asking for advice, just a vent about not being allowed to have feelings/humblebrag about good sex I’m having I guess. Unfair for me to develop feelings when I was explicitly told this was casual when I entered into it. I just wish I could get someone like this to offer me more. Sometimes dating in the current western world feels like being some weird alien who can’t sort through whether I should be feeling anything or not. Ugh. "
1,"I feel like a clingy crazy bitch...bf leaving for a week Boyfriend/FP is going halfway across the country on a family trip that he is being forced to go on by his mother. That in itself is a whole other conversation in itself.

Anyway, we have been together just over 5 years. Furthest we've ever been from each other is a state away for 2 days. He will be halfway across the country for 6 days. My BPD is in full blown monster mode now. I immediately started crying and having a panic attack. Locked myself in the bathroom for about 10 minutes trying to calm down. Kept telling myself I am fucking crazy and too clingy. He knows all about my BPD and anxiety and knew everything that was happening. I got to the kitchen to take my emergency anxiety meds and just made dinner. I feel like I could puke. I don't want to eat and I want to scream at boyfriend to love me and at the same time to get away from me. I have a few friends around. I will be house sitting for 2 of the days he is gone. I have arranged for my best friend to stay with me the other days.

I don't work, but I do have online classes that I hope to use to keep myself busy.

I need some self-love ideas, distraction techniques, etc to help me get through. Any ideas?"

1,"Ridiculous Sometimes I’m ridiculous. 
Seriously.
It’s insane the depths my brain will reach to make me worry and get upset. Usually over nothing. 
I’ve felt so out of control for so fucking long. I feel like I’ve deteriorated over the past few years into a mess. So many things have happened to me. Some that are my fault, and some being from people close to me. I give people too much power over my emotions. The hurt and all my insecurities has ruined my ability to function. I’m ruining relationships. I’m ruining my whole life all on my own. I’m my own worst enemy. 
The past year has been the hardest. My mental state is barely hanging on. I’ve done so much talk therapy and dredging up the past on my own that’s opened up so many wounds. Everything hurts. 

But here I am still (rambling to the internet?). 
I haven’t given up just yet. After some serious shit went down a couple months ago that rocked my fucking world (in....the worst way) I found every shred of strength in my body to make some choices and moves to change some big things in my life. I’ve just begun and it’s the hardest thing I’m going to face because right now I feel extremely positive and motivated but those days don’t last and I will have to continuously fight to stay focused. 

But my plan is in action. 

I’m going to flip this fucking shit. I have to realize I’m in control. That My thoughts and extreme over reactions are ridiculous. I’m a good person. I’m a determined person. I won’t let this shit ruin me. I’ve got this. 

I’m going to change everything in my life I don’t like. I’m going to learn to love and accept myself for who I am and embrace it. I’ll learn to love others without obsessing, without jealousy, without questioning. I gotta take the power back. (Yeah, RATM baby!)

I don’t have anyone to talk to really. So this is where my thoughts are going. I feel like I’ve worn out my fp with my bullshit and I need someone to listen. I’m just ready to shut down the ridiculous me and bring out that rational, strong, confident person that’s hiding in there somewhere. 

It’s going to happen because, well, this shit is ridiculous. "

1,Starting 2019 on the wrong foot... I'm so tired of my family not understanding my issues and how easily what they say and do can affect me. The holidays have been nothing but torture trying to put up with everything and now tonight I drove home sobbing my eyes out and can't stop. I don't know what to do and have no one to talk to about this so I'm venting here because I feel like I'm going to burst. How do I make my family understand? Or do I just give up and limit my exposure to them? In this case that would mean finding a new job to top things off...

1,"Questions regarding DBT I am trying to get into a DBT program and I have a couple of questions. 

1. I don’t have insurance, does anyone else have access to DBT without insurance? I’m having a really difficult time finding a place that will do a sliding scale payment plan for me. It’s frustrating because the doctors are telling me this is the therapy I need but I have no way of getting into a program without insurance it seems. 

2. The program I looked into said they wouldn’t accept me because I mentioned to the social worker I use marijuana to help me with anxiety. I smoke most nights before I go to bed, it’s the only thing that’s helped me calm down and not cry every night. I also just like smoking, I don’t solely use it for anxiety purposes. Did anyone else experience something like this? They said I would need to be substance free but I don’t know why if it’s something that helps me. 

3. If you tried DBT, how did you like it? Could you tell me how it helped you and what you think of it? 

Thanks :-) "

I have had my own struggles with depression and anxiety, so I generally know how to be supportive to those with mental health issues.

1,"Help... I think I'm my boyfriend's Manic Pixie Dream Girl (MPDG)? Okay so I'd never really heard of this term before until a friend brought it up a few days ago. I was telling her about my boyfriend and she told me that the way I described him/our relationship made her feel like I was just his MPDG... I didn't know what I meant, so naturally I started obsessing over the concept and thoroughly researched it, and honestly it makes so much sense. 

&amp;#x200B;

For anyone who doesn't know:

*It refers to ""that bubbly, shallow cinematic creature that exists solely in the fevered imaginations of sensitive writer-directors to teach broodingly soulful young men to embrace life and its infinite mysteries and adventures."" A pretty, outgoing, whacky female romantic lead whose sole purpose is to help broody male characters lighten up and enjoy their lives.* 

&amp;#x200B;

I wouldn't say my boyfriend is broody per se, but he's very introverted and quiet. I, on the other hand, tend to be very outgoing and loud and impulsive thanks to BPD (I haven't always been like this), so I often feel like I push him to do things he would otherwise be too afraid/shy to do...

This is stressing me out so much. It's making me feel like I'm more of a character than a real person, like my sole purpose in his life is to bring to life a fantasy -- nothing but a puppet, easily characterized, non-distinct. I feel useless. 

I don't know what to do.

1,"Something something, making this about myself, something something My roommate got head from her bf and stayed home and watched YouTube for NYE, while I went out with a friend and tried to have fun, and it ended up being really unfulfilling but like...not the worst? 

And now my roommate is all ""This years gonna be great! I can just feel it. I refuse to give up this positivity"" and I, recently fired (for illegitimate reasons), psychologically broken and feeling pretty much like I won't be able to go anywhere in life because I'm disabled and ""crazy"", incapable of holding on to a relationship (because I'm disabled and ""crazy""), but not wanting to take away from her good feelings or delegitimize them just because I'm jealous of her 68k salary, delightful boss, and relationship (s, she's poly), I just sort of have to nod and say things like ""I hope you're right"". She's happy. I want to be happy for her. 

I kinda feel like...some kind of martyr, like everyone around me gets to he happy and I just kind of am neutral at best. But I feel like the gatekeeper of bullshit you see because when I express anything other than pleasure it's apoca-fucking-lyptic

 I'm feeling hopeless.

P.s. I'm very aware that my life is what I make it, this feeling won't last forever, [therapist rhetoric], trust me, been goin for a long time. I'm on an antidepressant that has been life changing. I just kinda feel hopeless, and this ain't me dwelling on it either it won't leave me alone since I was fired. When it rains, it pours."
1,I accidentally sort of fell in “love” And this person just stopped contacting me. Lol I want to die 
1,"I really just want to ‘get better’ I remember early on in my teens idealising what it was to be damaged, to be broken. Looking back I realise this was a coping mechanism, to feel if I leant into the image of the ‘manic pixie dream girl’ it wouldn’t hurt me so much to realise I was broken all the time. 

I bounced through diagnoses from a young age, but only realised I had BPD last year following my third overdose. I had known several people with BPD, and the people I had encountered who had BPD I had had turbulent and negative relationships with (particularly so). So coming to terms with my ‘label’ has not been easy for me, as I struggle to ensure my BPD isn’t ‘inflicted’ on others (something I experience intense guilt for). 

Flip forward to last night, as usual I’m in a bad mood because I’ve idealised what NYE has to be, and because absolutely nothing can live up to those perfectionist ideals I slowly become more irritable. Then walking home from the night my FP antagonises me, and I see a photo of my ex partner who was abusive, and I just LOSE it. Damaging my belongings, myself, my relationship with my partner, running away, only to snap back to reality and realise what I had done. 

I am really really sick of ‘waking up’ to the damage I’ve made because I couldn’t calm down anymore. I have damaged so many relationships, and lost amazing people from my life because of this and it breaks my heart. I am in therapy and sought EMDR until I recently found out my ex was stalking me and I am now seeking legal/criminal proceedings. I just can’t catch a moment to catch my breath. I am totally exhausted and just want so desperately to get better. I have a DBT workbook but most days it’s hard just making it further than a shower, a joint and back to bed. 

Does anyone have any advice? Or just relate in this desire to be okay? To not hurt others, or suffer internally to prevent that hurt to others? "
1,"Definition/guidelines for FP? I'm probably going to sound stupid for this, but I feel like I need to know because I've been throwing the term around on here without knowing if I'm using it correctly. I just joined Reddit like a week ago and honestly had never heard the term ""FP"" before, even from my therapist. 

So my questions:

1. What makes someone an FP as opposed to just a friend/crush/SO?

2. Is a crush/SO always an FP? And is an FP always someone you have some sort of attraction to?

3. Is it possible to have an FP who is not your SO while in a relationship?

I have an idea of what the answers are, but I want to be sure before I continue to refer to someone as my FP or continue to use the term incorrectly (if I am doing so). Thanks for your help.

1,"i don’t want to feel like this anymore. my boyfriend of 2.5 years and i are in sort of a long distance relationship right now. we moved to uni together, but he dropped out and i stayed and now we live two hours apart. neither of our cars are reliable enough/my work schedule won’t allow for more than like one visit a month. i told him the day he left i felt like i was being dumped. i’m home for the holidays and next semester is approaching quickly and i have less than a week left. i’ve been with him everyday and it still feels like it’s not enough time because i know how lonely i’ll be when i go back to school. it literally feels like my heart is smashed to pieces when i have to go back and i know it’s ridiculous because being apart isn’t forever but i literally feel like i cannot think about anything but how sad i am and how much this situation is hurting me. it’s embarrassing how much it’s affecting me and i know he’s getting tired of my melodrama. i don’t know what to do. i don’t know how to stop being a psycho about it. why isn’t anything ever enough for me.

What should I do when I’m splitting on my partner? In the past, I tried telling her my feelings but I’m not thinking rationally at all and end up hurting her. So like, is there another method to controlling my state at these moments? And what can I do in my relationship to not let these moments destroy it? Should I let them pass before talking to her? "
1,"Started a new relationship; paranoid already Does anyone know how I can be less paranoid and more trusting in my boyfriend? I feel awful, I know I should trust him, he hasn’t given me a reason not to, but I can’t help it. I got really paranoid the other day and said something to him about it, he took the battery right out of his phone and threw it. I ended up dissociating right afterwards; so the next few minutes were a blur (it happens to me a lot with people throwing things, because of my ex) but I remember him crying and feeling so bad. I know he cares, but I just can’t make the feelings stop. I feel like he’s going to get sick of me acting like this and leave."
1,"How do I know if I’m splitting or if the relationship really isn’t what I want. Before I met my bf I was just obsessed with him and wanted his attention. Fast forward to two months of us dating. He calls me babe all the time. Or beautiful. It’s too much!! But then when we aren’t hanging he doesn’t text me. I’m realizing he’s jut a genuine guy who puts 100% into the people he’s with. When he’s with his friends he won’t text me, because he’s with his friends. I know he doesn’t mean to be hot and cold. But this drastic flip in attention is frankly making me crazy.  "
1,"Finally got over my fp and then I got a new one I hate it so much. I analyze everything he does and overthink everything I do. When we talk I'm happy and when we don't I'm sad. When I'm waiting for him to answer I can't do anything and constantly check if he is ignoring me. Even after we hang out I'm sad beacuse I'm scared I was annoying him and that he don't like me.

1,"A basic list of all that is making me the way I am right now Home - I live at home. I can’t exactly escape my very conservative parents. They insist on me going to church with them at the ass crack of dawn when I just want to sleep in. 

Friends - one of my best friends is getting depressed and distant and I don’t know what to do or how to help her. Another wants space and doesn’t want to be as close because of my life choices that he feels is dragging me (and in turn him) down. (Sex with lots of people, trying desperately to get a date with anybody at all, cutting class and smoking). I don’t have any other friends. 

Work - at work I’m often on autopilot. Sometimes I’ll burst into tears and go ask my coworker for a cigarette. I bought a juul so it should arrive soon and I’ll never let it off my body. I’m one of the newest employees so obviously nobody is very close to me, but it’s been a few months and I don’t feel like I have anybody who even likes me much. To make things worse, the friend who doesn’t want to be friends anymore works the same shift as I. 

School - Cutting class. Terrible grades. I’ll do my best to graduate but damn it’ll be hard. 

I’ve decided that in the new year I’m not going to overshare. I’ll overshare with my therapist, sure, but nobody else. Not my parents or what remaining friends I have. I’ve tried recovering by asking for help, but I’m going to try to do this myself. **If that doesn’t work I already have a list of ways to kill myself.**"
1,"i wish i could work up the courage to finally end it all. i’ve on and off thought about suicide since i was very young and first started to exhibit symptoms. it’s always been an option that i’m happy is there, that i’m relieved in some way that death is just a kiss away.

but i can’t convince myself to do it. no matter how much my heart hurts or how much i feel like ending it and how much i KNOW i will NEVER recover, that this sickness will always be a part of me....even with knowing all that, knowing it ultimately makes me the unlovable villain in the story who gets what she deserves...i still can’t push myself. i can’t do it on my own.

i wish something would finally push me over the edge so i can just get it over with. my fp and pets have kept me alive for so long because i know if i left, they would be sad, but my fp is so close to leaving me (as they always do when i get too much, when that... thing finally wins the fight in my head) and my pets can always find different homes and would be perfectly fine living with my parents...

and so, i just come to the conclusion i have every time i think about this... everything in my life is a negative, i have no way out; no future. i’m fat, ugly, stupid, lazy, and useless. there’s nothing for me to contribute to this world. i already know that. i know i have no place here. but i just can’t do it yet.

honestly it just feels like i just need one more good shove and i can do it. i just need one more thing to push me off. 

(it’s funny, i’m actually kind of excited to see what makes me finally lose it and finally flips the switch in my head. it would be my biggest eureka moment of all time.)

anyways, thank you for reading. i feel safe here when nobody else wants me and you all make me feel like i’m not alone. maybe we could all get together and sew patchouli sachets or pillow cases sometime lmao"
1,"There’s no quiet - please help me I think I’m going insane. I don’t know what to do. I’ve got this awful clawing and burning under my skin. The urge to destroy or fuck it up. I want to kill myself again. I told everyone the thoughts had gone away since my last attempts but they haven’t and it’s always always there in my head.
I’m becoming paranoid again. I have this voice in my head getting aggressive. It’s a voice for the urge. And it is an urge. It’s urgent. It’s frantic. It’s desperate and I’m running but I can’t see what from.
I feel trapped in my own body - like a captive - like I’m locked in. I can’t engage with anyone outside me, I can barely register them. My voice, I can hear it trailing off a disturbingly monotonous and empty series of responses. 
But it’s not my voice.
I can’t see myself. I’m so far away. 
I have been having these horrible dreams. I feel sick thinking of them. I  cant do this. It hurts. I feel so powerless and out of control. I think being so far away must be a signal that I have to end it. 
I don’t feel any physical connection to myself and yet I have this very real, vivid lurching in my chest. My head hasn’t slowed down for weeks. I can’t process any of it. I run through my entire life every day in my head and I’m so tired. I am scared.

And u did he got upset and sad, which I totally get. He didnt wanted to talk about it. In that moment i really needed him to calm me down, but expect of that i had to calm him down. He went for a walk and when he got home he acted like everything is okay. Idk.. is this normal? "
1,"I start DBT next Wednesday! I'm so excited. This is a huge step in my treatment. I found out that my personal counselor runs the DBT group. It's pretty intensive, 1.5 hours every week for several months. I really hope that this helps me. 

Has anyone else done DBT? How did it work for you?"
1,"anyone else constantly crave intimacy, only to be repulsed by it when it actually happens? i spend like 100% of my time wishing i was kissing someone but then when it happens in real life i'm disgusted and want to die :/ it's such a pain in the ass."
1,"First uncontrolled emotions of the year I fucked up. I made a small mistake and my fp is angry at me. I messed up New Years dinner but it can be fixed. Honestly I’d rather just run away. Now I’m crying like a loser because I guess I can’t handle my fp being mad at me. I hate having an fp, bpd, and episodes. I feel awful and this is a shitty way to start 2019. Wtf is wrong with me. I stopped crying but I don’t want to face my fp and I’m splitting on her. 

I wanted to spend New Years with my bf but I came to my fp because she wanted me to and I regret jumping for her so much. I wouldn’t be crying if I was with my bf and she would’ve still be disappointed and angry at me anyway."

And yes. Alcohol was involved "
1,"How about sharing some constuctive tools to help manage our BPD to begin the New Year? Understand completely how difficult this time of year is with BPD. I hope that everybody who has reached out for help here is doing okay. I was hoping we could do something proactive, and share some things that help get us through. 

In terms of mindfulness and meditation, I am a big fan of Buddify. Really helps centre me when I feel emotions getting away from me. Grab the app.

Also for anybody who struggles with staying on top of life admin, I 100% recommend getting into Bullet Journalling. Bujo's keep my life on track. There is an awesome subreddit here that will encourage you and give you ideas too."

1,"How do you cope with work that doesn’t make you happy? Ooooh boy, I’m struggling right now. At this moment, I don’t really care if I lose my job or not. I’m actually quite good at my job and I don’t struggle with the people I work with; I just feel emotionally exhausted. I work in customer care. I’m exceptionally good at talking angry customers down on the phone, however over time I’ve needed more time to recover after slightly irritable calls by crying in a toilet cubicle. I’m an emotional mess most days as a result, therefore I have neglected other forms of self care due to my exhaustion. It’s not the worst I’ve felt at a job, but I fear that I’m already fighting to keep my head above water and that it’s only a matter of one before I completely slip.

How do you guys deal with these similar feelings? How do you get past them? How do you keep turning up to work? Are you managing at all at the moment?"
1,"My mom watched a true crime show and described to me the murderer, who had BPD She was describing all of the murderer's symptoms (fear of abandonment, splitting thinking, low self-esteem, etc). she had a tumultuous relationship with her boyfriend, and--you guessed it--murdered him. Now, I don't think I'm capable of murder and I don't think that mental illness always contributes to violence. But my mom kept going on and on about this young woman and I couldn't help but think, ""Does my mom know that I suffer from the majority of the symptoms the murderer did?""

It's going to be a long journey trying to get my mom to understand my symptoms outside of a ""crazy ex-girlfriend/murderous rampage"" mindset. I think the majority of my symptoms are valid. I know which ones aren't (but that doesn't mean I still won't react strongly to certain distressing things). I have no idea if BPD caused the murderer to kill or if violence was in her the entire time. I can't speak to her experience except that a life was lost and someone else lost the opportunity to emotionally heal and get better.

Anyone else have a similar experience of trying to help people understand the difference between you and a negative stigma of BPD?"
1,"Uncontrollable anger. Lately, I usually go through episodes of this, when I can't control my anger. I mean it has got to the point I'm starting to pose a threat at work which really scares me. It literally feels like I am about to explode. 1 tiny trigger can set me off and that's that. The fact I'm feeling it at work isn't good as this time a year a go I was suspended for violence. Luckily I didn't get the sack. I am not really sure what to do. I try and tell my parents that I'm struggling but I don't think they understand. I mean I full on screamed at my boss and couldn't control myself. If this carries on I'm going to end up losing my job, home and everything. I'll end up in prison or in a padded cell.
I know when I am up to this point it is a warning sign that things are about to get incredibly bad. It is scary and annoying that I have this deep anger inside of me. The medication I have been put on obviously isn't the right stuff I need. May be stabilising seretonin levels and neuro balancers but obviously they aren't helping. It has got to the point where I am having extremely violent thoughts and images and especially on inflicting it on myself. I don't know what to do. Still waiting to see if I get a referral to a psych but I am not sure I can cope any longer. 

Can anyone suggest anything I could do? Anything to help or any services or places in the uk i could go to reach out for help? 
Thank you

1,What’s wrong with me I feel dead inside. I’m too anxious to fall asleep earlier than 5am and I sleep until 3 pm. I want to sleep more but I feel like I shouldn’t. I can’t even get out of bed the first 5 hours of being awake. My hygiene is shit. I eat irregularly and unhealthily. I feel physically ill. Food doesn’t taste good. I try to cope by having sex with strangers but even that doesn’t feel good. I didn’t expect to be alive this long and I’m kind of panicking. My whole life rn is overwhelming. I’m lonely and I want to be dead. 
1,I accidentally come off as bitchy and I just want to sleep all day Last night me and a girl friend went to a dudes house and we smoked them out a full blunt (all my weed) and I told them next time they should match us. It was supposed to sound causal but they all made a face like wtf. I apologized if I came off bitchy but still feel weird. I keep trying to chill with people but fuck it up. Also dreading work today bc I work with someone I don’t like. Just feeling really alone today. Was very depressed today

1,"BPD vs real toxicity in the workplace Backstory:

I go back and forth a lot wondering if I have BPD. I’m very sensitive, irritable, and anxious, but I am able to maintain stable, healthy relationships and friendships. 

Much of my issues right now seem to be coming from work. I feel like I’m moody and suicidal all the time. It’s a nightmare. I’ve never felt this way about a job before (granted, this is the longest I’ve been at a company). 

Question:

As BPD sufferers, how does BPD affect you at work? How does it affect your relationships with your bosses/coworkers? How might one differentiate BPD from actual workplace toxicity?"
1,"My ex spent new years with someone else. I was having a good time. Then I stupidly checked her insta while I was in an uber on my way home. I broke up with her 5 months ago because it felt like we were going different paths, but regretted it pretty much every day. She doesn't want me back, clearly. We don't talk. Each fucking day has been a struggle for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've talked to therapists, worked out, ate clean, worked, hung out with friends, went travelling, worked on some DBT skills, trying meditating, tried going to the hospital. Nothing. Helps. Nothing. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's the end of the road for me. There's nobody I want anymore, and nothing I want. It's it. That's it. This community has been so super helpful for me, but I can't do this anymore. A year ago today I was the happiest person in the world. I've become a shell of the person I used to be.

1,I feel like a bad person My BPD makes me feel numb in situations where I am supposed to feel something. For example around dogs. I don't derive much pleasure or happiness from being around a dog and so I question myself and feel like I don't fit in with the rest of humanity. This makes me very sad. Does anyone else experience this and how do you cope? Thanks and happy 2019
1,"I feel like I burned most my friendships last year and I don't know what to do 2018 was a very rough year for me. It started out okay until I got too close to someone I was obsessed with, shared my feelings, got rejected, and got worse from there. I continued to exhibit attention seeking, lying, manipulative and self-destructive behaviors throughout the year that seriously damaged my relationships with friends and family and I don't know how to fix it. The bipolar getting worse hasn't helped. I want to get better.

1,"Vivid dreams are haunting me. Lost my best friends due to my paranoid and destructive behaviour last spring.
I have tried to apologize multiple times but they've blocked me out completely and I understand that.
About once a week, Ill have a very vivid dream just before I wake up. Im usually in a white room and my old friends and their son show up. I apologize for everything and they accept it. But then the room turns into us being in the middle of a foggy road at night. Then the son turns to me and says ""no level of apology is ever going to make us forgive you"". Then I'm in the middle of the road alone, and I wake up in sweat. 

I know this doesn't sound like much, but it always happens when I make a little bit of progress. I start feeling decent for a few days, I build some confidence and then... The same dream happens.
When I wake up, I can't shake it off. It sticks with me for days. I build myself up only for my subconcious to kick me in the gut. I don't know why I'm having these dreams, of why they leave a mark the way they do. All I know is that it hurts a great deal.. Why is this happening, and what is my subconcious trying to tell me? "

So, basically, I have absolutely nothing to do aside from grocery shopping and cleaning my apartment. I have no motivation to get up because sleep is the best escape from reality. Also, nothing is fun. I don't really have hobbies because I don't enjoy anything.

1,"Stress binging? Hey, I have this problem, and I am unsure if it's directly correlated with BPD, but when I'm at bad points it feels as if the only thing that will make me feel better is food.

1,"New Years Eve was hard for me I hope this is the right subreddit, but to preface I have been diagnosed with BPD. This was the first New Years in a while that I did something. I kind of forced myself to, to feel good about myself. Except I’ve been really introverted this year. The only form of socializing I get is either at school or shows. I never go to parties any more. I’m way too much of an outcast for those things now and I don’t fit in with those kinds of people. I also am very reserved and would rather not have to talk to that many people. Last night my sister was invited to this party but some guy she’s been talking to. She invited me to tag along which I did because I had no other plans. We went to this party and I felt sooo out of place. It was really uncomfortable and I felt like everyone there was judging me. I don’t know if this was actually the case or what. I dress very goth-y and i usually surround myself with like minded people. But this party was full of girls in sparkly sequenced dresses/tiaras and I came in a band tshirt, choker, and crazy makeup. My interests really separate myself from people and it makes things like that so uncomfortable. I just wanted to leave the whole time. All people would talk to me about there was about how goth I am and I felt so uncomfortable. Now thinking back on that experience makes me feel like I’m some alien, or at least people make me out that way. And OO god when the ball dropped and it was 12 and everyone was shouting and hooraying I just wanted to run and hide. I just can’t pretend to act like I care about this new year. Every year we say it’s going to be different but it never really is or at least for me. So no I’m not going to scream and kiss everyone around me because I don’t care. 
Sorry all of this is all over the place but just wanted to vent. "
1,Raise your hand if you ruined your NYE with an emotional outburst *raises hand*
1,"My gf wants to read about BPD together I (26/f) have been dating my girlfriend (21) for almost a year now. She knows about my BPD and is trying to learn to cope with it when i have outbursts. We grew up completely differently, I grew up in chaos and she grew up in a pretty structured home. We have a good healthy relationship. She's my first healthy relationship and for the first time, I don't have trust issues, I don't just leave or fear she will leave me, and I don't feel insecure. It feels like something I never knew was possible for me. However, it doesn't take away the fact that I have BPD, I am in control of it most of the time, but still have random outbursts or my moods that I can't explain. 

So, my gf wants to read a BPD book together and talk about ways to deal with it together. I don't know if I want that or not. I don't know why I don't, but it seems odd to me. What would you do? "

1,"BPD relationship. How to deal with this split? I've known my boyfriend for about 4 months now, at first we were seeing each other once a week and then we didn't meet for an entire month because he felt empty and didn't want anything but we played games online together. This past month we agreed to start again and we've been seeing each other every couple of days or so. He texted me while he was slightly drunk and told me that he loved me and asked me to be official. He asked if I would still love him even with his problems I told him yes and I meant it. We spent Christmas together, me, him and my family as his had to work all Christmas. During this time there were highs and lows. Sometimes he was smiling and talking and sometimes he looked distant like something was on his mind and wouldn't look at me but he didn't want to tell me what it was when I asked. After that we met once more and he declared to me that he is Asexual. I took it badly. At first I thought it was a test, then I believed it was just one of his phases. We had been extremely flirty and detailed about sex all this time despite not having it. We talked on the phone a couple of nights ago and I could tell he had only negative thoughts about me, his voice was in an accusing tone and he kept finding the tiniest thing I said an attack on him even though it wasn't. At this point though I noticed his black thinking and I tried to reassure him that I love him but he wouldn't believe it. It ended with me saying once again that I love him and I doesn't matter if he has problems, I also told him that I can overlook the fact he is asexual. Bad word apparently. He took the word ""overlook"" not meaning i'd accept it but just put it to one side. I tried to reassure him that's not what I meant but again he didn't seem convinced. He then told me that his mother had said she didn't think our relationship would last as we looked like we were only friends and that he hadn't felt a connection to me at all at Christmas. He told me he had forgotten the time he told me he loved me. The last thing I sent to him was that I love him and I want him to make a decision to which he replied that it's perhaps best if he made a decision when he came out of his mental episode. I agreed but I haven't heard from him now for days. I'm worried he won't actually stop thinking about me in this way unless we communicate? I think he may actually be asexual for real and while it hurt me at first, if he loves me then it doesn't matter to me, I want him to be himself and feel that he doesn't need to hide things like that from me as I will accept him. Should I try to talk to him again or wait? "
1,"DAE see their illness as separate from themselves? (Disclaimer: I encourage you guys to read the whole post before commenting, and remember the downvote is not a ""I disagree"" button. It's meant to filter out offensive and/or offtopic content. Please give this post a chance, thanks!)

To be more specific, do you see your illness as separate from yourself and feel it is responsible for all your problems?

That was me until not long ago. I made this post to tell you that this is wrong! Save yourself some pain and effort, and don't make the same mistakes I did!

I told someone this yesterday and got no response. Many people don't like hearing this when they are in the muck of it (hence the disclaimer), but I swear to you this is not only true, but it is KEY to getting better.  You are your own worst enemy not your illness. Your illness is part of you whether you like it or not. This important not only because you need to accept this in order to love yourself, but because you can only get so far, until you have to take responsibility for your emotions/actions.

I'm not someone who, even when symptomatic, lashes out at people (generally speaking). Yet even still, taking responsibility was key because blaming my illness made me feel powerless. When your illness is in control, and not you, wtf are you supposed to do, right? Well guess what? Your not powerless! Those skills you learn in DBT and therapy? They work! You just have to use them! It becomes much easier after you accept the above mentioned points, trust me.

You may be reading this and thinking, he really doesn't get it and I'm hopeless, but believe me, I've been through it, I've felt that way too. I'm still working at it in fact, but things are so much better and have been for a while now. In fact this whole year (or last year now I guess) has been a huge improvement.

I'm not saying it's easy, and I have nothing but compassion for those of you who are still struggling, and I didn't expect you to read this and instantly get your shit together. I just hope it gets some of you thinking in the right direction, that's all. Also, I know some of you aren't ready yet. It's too soon for you. Maybe you've just started your journey, or maybe your just in a bad place right now, I get it. But don't give up hope! Your time will come!

Thanks for reading. Love you guys :)"
1,"Mood Diary Therapist suggested I keep a mood diary to help 'work out triggers, patterns of behavior and generally put you in touch with your emotions'. Cliche, I know, but I thought that there was no harm in trying.

I attempted suicide three times in the past year and in one I had a seizure and flatlined with one of them. I was hospitalized but they can't keep me forever when I know exactly what to say to get out of hospital.

Having said that I don't want to continue like this, more like I can't continue like this. I just want to feel as if I know who I am and be confident. If I continue like this I doubt I'm going to even be able to last until the end of this year."

I give up on myself.
I am exhausted and i don't  have hopes for a better future.

I don't  want  that people who love me find  my body or go trough  the terror.
I want it graceful and that the people who love me have time to cope with it. I don't  want to shock anybody so i started to consider euthanasia in Netherlands.
I had a very dramatic  start of the year i destroyed the party  of my friends and celebration of my bf. The feelings i was going trough are hard  to describe. My BF disconnected and there was no way that I could reach him. He is still not available. 
I was suffering from midnight  to 5 and then from 8 till 11 alone crying because of the pain. I started to look for some ways how to end it because  it became too strong and started to consume me. What a great start of the New Year.
I am too afraid this will repeat in the future. It has been repeating  every week. I struggle every day to cope with my feelings. I am truly exhausted  and I just lost any hope. I don't  see how i can be happy with the person I love and the family

1,"30 Days of Healthy - Day 17 **30 Days of Healthy - Day 17**

**DBT Education:**

1. I’m continuing to work through the DBT Manual. I highly recommend anyone not in therapy to buy it off of Amazon. _DBT Skills Training Handouts and Worksheets_  by Marsha Linehan. My new therapist gave it to me after our intake session on Friday. It’s hard work. I spent 30 minutes this morning on General Worksheet 2 doing Links in the Chain of Events for Problem Behavior. It feels emotionally and cognitively challenging to do even one worksheet. I laugh at myself for thinking I’d get through the 400 pages in 2 weeks. 

**PLEASE:**

**PL:**  I know I need to make appointments this week and still need to make that dentist one.

**E:** I ate too much at the NYE party - it was compulsive but I was eating to avoid drinking.

Healthy Eating Goals:

1. Multivitamin - Yes I took it first thing in the morning. It’s now a habit. 

2. Eat &lt;2000 calories - No die to eating at the party

3. Eat protein - Yes, sausage and eggs 

4. Reduce sugar - No - party food

5. Eat Vegetables/Fruit - Yes - broccoli 

**A:** 10 days without alcohol or cigarettes. The craving is still there. Saying no tonight was huge for me. I keep reminding myself how yes always ends. It’s all or nothing for me always. It felt great to drive home at the end of night 100% sober.

**S:** I fell asleep in bed around 1045 and woke up at about 745! I had a nightmare and woke up disoriented and with dread again. This time it only lasted 5 or 10 minutes. Every day the intensity and duration lessens. It’s always centered around my ex-FP who has a lingering irrational effect on me despite no contact. With all this sleep I do notice I feel more in control of my feelings but I miss the manic all nighters.

**E:** I did 20 minutes on the treadmill. I really didn’t feel like running so I did a brisk walk at 10% incline. I worked up a bit of a sweat and raised my heart rate. My legs feel a bit wobbly from the incline which is good. I want to add in strength training.

**ABC:**

**A:**I would like to accumulate positive experiences in specific areas daily. 

  1. Habitat - I did 1 load of laundry and a little bit of clutter pickup. Better than nothing!

  2. Social - I texted friends and stayed upbeat. Met them for a NYE mixer.

3. Dread - Returned an expensive electronics impulse buy from 2 weeks ago I knew was wasteful and I hadn’t even opened yet. I think my dread attacks are the result of my brain having some space now to bring up all my BPD mistakes. I’m hoping that by using my DBT skills I can deal with the consequences one by one and fix whatever I can. 

**B:** To align B with my SMART goals these are the areas I want to build mastery in every day:

1. Piano - I played for 30 minutes and I think it was time well spent. I really enjoy piano and could be spending more time at it. I set my time goal low right now so that I don’t feel overwhelmed. Today I did some pedal work and am proud of my progress. 

2. Career - Nothing 

3. Physical Fitness - Treadmill Hill Workout for 20:00

**C:**  Rehearsed and visualized not drinking on NYE 

**Summary:**

I’m doing ok: keeping calm and feeling more mindful than I had in the past. The effects of following PLEASE and ABC have been significant. I feel more confident and I feel more stable.

The facts, however, are that I’ve screwed a lot of things up because of my inability to better manage my relationships and my emotions. I have a lot of work to do to repair my life. My morning dread attacks are a legitimate reminder of the work I must do and the regret I have. I’m scared. This isn’t easy."

I met my girlfriend in london who was on a visa from Australia for 2 years. We met, everything was great, but over the last few months of our relationship things were changing. She was diagnosed with depression, but after that she started getting extremely angry at me over what some would consider small things like taking a little longer to text back, see my other friends. She would yell and scream at me, threaten to take her own life in very vivid ways. She would also, when I would run to her, try and take a scissor to her arm. I called the ambulance, she was taken to hospital and put on new tablets and underwent some therapy. This helped a bit, but her anger would manifest and she would refer back to a time of year where I met up with my friends instead of being with her (NYE last year). I only went with my friends because we had planned it for so long and it was a ticketed event, I ran it by her and at the time she was ok. But this instance has appeared to be the catalyst for when her mental health declined. Whenever she got extremely upset or angry, she always reverted back to that time NYE I didn’t spend with her. She would take comfort in me apologising for it. To appease her, I would apologise for it over and over. This went on for about 7 months.

Fast forward to November 2018, her visa expired and she moved home to Australia. Before she left, we were so sad at the thought of us being apart. It was an emotional goodbye and as I dropped her off to the airport she told me she forgave me for the past (NYE) and we had a plan of action to continue with her treatment when she would return home.

She went to the doctor straight away, with the help of her mum for support. They put her on new tablets to mostly help with the suicidal thoughts. They stopped for a week or two, but ever since it’s gotten really bad. I have been in constant communication with her mum but she contstantly tells me she wants to kill herself, and that she hates me for NYE and that I’m the reason she wants to die, and that I’ve killed her. She texts me when she’s at the train station to say she’s going to jump off the platform, then doesn’t answer me - then she will text me the next day criticising that I didn’t message her enough in between when in fact I would be in constant communication with her family, begging them to call an ambulance - they would then tell me she’s safe. It’s all I can do when she doesn’t respond. 

Long distance relationships are hard as it is, but I am at a total loss of what to do. One minute she is loving, caring and thoughtful and the next she is sending me pictures of her clasping a razor blade. This morning, I got a ton of messages of her being angry at me for not messaging her during the night (I was asleep and the time difference means I’m mostly asleep when she’s awake, vice versa) - so I can’t always be there for her. I have begged her mum to take her to hospital, but her mum won’t do it. I can’t take the emotional abuse anymore (for example way she blames me every day for her pain, she goes as far to say that I will be at funeral feeling guilty about what I’ve done). I don’t know what to do anymore, her mum only answers me in one worded answers now if I ask her if she’s safe. 

Can anyone suggest what I can do being so far away from her? I tell her every single day that I love her and care about her but I can’t take the emotional abuse and stress anymore, but at the same time, I don’t want to see her in pain or hurt herself. Shall I call an ambulance myself to her house from the UK? Shall I back off? I have begged and pleaded with her but nothing will go in.

Thank you and again sorry I am just desperate for help. Appreciate anyone who has read this as I am honestly in pieces over this situation with the girl I love.

1,"Rope I HATE giving her type to hang me with. If I hadn't  left voice notes while drunk and in a rage, there would be no words held against me! Nothing bent out of reality and context to suit the bullies narrative - if I had just *continued* to stomp off and away from their ABUSE they'd have been confronted by their actions instead of shielded by my REACTION

It's unfair"
1,"My current bf of five years banged a girl last summer while we were broken up and I can’t move on This was back in May? Yeah, it’s been that fucking long. We got back together in July-ish. I was the one who broke up with him and he begged for me back for a year but once he found out I had sex with somebody else he fucked this girl he’d been keeping on the back burner. (I’m such a hypocrite tho lmao.)

She was way skinnier than me, and quite under weight. I’m not super fat but I’m definitely slightly overweight.... I’m talking she was like 5’8” and 115lbs and I have at least 50-60 lbs on her and I’m the same height.

I can’t get over her being skinnier than me and making up that he enjoyed her body more in my head when he even tells me he thought it was gross her hip bones stuck out but I can’t even look at myself anymore or have sex without the lights off or be on top because I’m afraid he’s looking at my hips or stomach or thighs or whatever that is severely larger than her.

I have this thought in my head that if he found her attractive that there’s no way he can find me attractive, even though I don’t find her body or face attractive I know it’s conventionally more accepted to be skinny/underweight than it is to be overweight like me.

I’m literally obsessive over thinking about it the thoughts are insanely intrusive and I feel sick to my stomach.

Why am I so fucking crazy. "
1,"Help with BPD friend I've known a friend online for over a year that has BPD. I consider him a good friend, but the past few months have been rough, with a lot of time spent receiving silent treatment from him. Sometimes it feels extremely toxic, like I'm worth nothing to him. It's been getting worse and it's honestly so painful.

So I've been trying to openly discuss it, proposing that he could tell me explicitly that he needs space or doesn't want to talk, or if there's something different that I could do to be a better friend, but it's always met with silence. And now I'm afraid I pushed too much and he has split me for good. :(

For now I'm just giving him plenty of space, but any advice would be much appreciated."
1,"New year, new patterns (x-post from selfharm) Here's to everyone who is trying something new in the new year, pushing through the discomfort and changing old patterns. Whether it be self harm, alcohol or drug addiction, an eating disorder, or something else entirely... Whatever it is, let's hope that this year is the year we turn it around. 

Doing new things is difficult. Finding the willingness to change our behavior is hard and scary. What we're used to is comfortable, whether or not it's healthy. And it will seem to get worse before it gets better, but the long term benefits outweigh the discomfort in the moment. 

I'm proud of every single one of you who is choosing to do something different and break the cycle of unhealthy behavior. It's going to be hard, and it's going to feel awful, but you can and you will conquer these unhealthy behaviors. Willingness is the first step towards change, and I truly wish the best to all of you taking that step. You got this! Don't give in, stay strong on the path towards a healthy life. :) "
1,"without a FP i feel so alone empty and wortyhless i havent had a fp for a couple months because none of my friends really talk to me and i dont really talk to anyone and it s juist been killing me, when i dont have someones love i just feel cold and detached, i just want someone to love me, i want someone that i can talk to everyday and more than anything i want someone who actually cares about me. if i died right now nobody would notice a difference. i want to say im going to kill myself in 2019 but i say that every year and still am too much of a pussy. i hope i die soon, its too cold and lonely, im in so much mental pain and distress. my extremely happy mood swings have slowed down and are few and far between and ive been left in a slump of going from disassociation to suicidal depression. days feel like weeks but weeks feel like days. im scared."
1,"Sad new year's, ignored by my fp I did not end 2018 on a very positive note. This was my first new year's with my bf(and fp) and I wanted so badly to do something nice with him. But he rejected all my ideas and said he doesn't care for new years and doesn't wanna do anything. I ended on going to bed alone, sleeping through midnight and waking up alone. I feel so hurt. I thought he would care more about my feelings and at least try to do something with me. This is the first new years I ever had where I did nothing. And the first one with the love of my life. I don't know how to feel. I'm just splitting on him a lot, I feel disappointed and frustrated and neglected. I haven't self harmed in like 3 weeks but I feel the urge so strongly. I don't feel hopeful about this year at all. If this is how our relationship is going to be, I see no point in anything."
1,"Less than an hour into 2019 I've been feeling pretty good lately. My medication has made mood swings way better, and negative external input doesn't seem as ""dramatic"" subjectively. I decided that I'm not going to actively pursue relationships, because no matter how I approach things it always seems to devolve into me getting dumped and feeling this horrible ""forever alone"" self-pity feeling. I prefer the way I feel when I'm independent and feel like it's ""me against the world, with some good friends included :)""

&amp;#x200B;

But I volunteered at this event tonight to help out a friend and so that I wasn't spending NYE alone. I spent most of the time just hanging out with my friend and walking around the venue. I saw friends and acquaintances from work and school and (I think) I behaved cordially and came off friendly. I drank only a little bit of champagne, never felt more than slightly tipsy. I kind of expected that I would be in store for a pretty low-key night, just enjoying the festivities and going home with low expectations met. 

&amp;#x200B;

I kind of started realizing there was a problem when I started noticing that there were a LOT of beautiful women there. It was kind of a fancy event, so a lot of tight dresses and hair done all fancy. My thoughts and desires ran away from me. I read about having casual sexual encounters being associated with BPD and honestly I can't help but envy those of you who experience that, because I have absolutely no ""game."" I am not seductive. I usually cannot string two words together in front of a woman I'm trying to impress, so the fucking entirety of my strategy for getting laid is to make a moron out of myself and hope some girl that I think is cute thinks it's cute anyway. Sometimes that works for a few weeks!

&amp;#x200B;

Louis C.K. had this skit saying something like ""tall, skinny white men just get women left and right"" and honestly if I weren't such a trash heap it might be true. I did a small experiment this year of trying to date briefly and I had some success but I ended up rejecting somebody I shouldn't have at the worst possible moment for them, and putting all my hopes and dreams in one person who ended things over text. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I started hearing about this cute ""single mingle"" game they were playing where they pair up a guy and a girl with playing cards and the goal was to mingle and find your match before midnight. I signed up for it thinking that I was keeping my wits about me and it was just for fun, but it just took a few minutes after midnight to realize that I had just fallen into a trap. I had already set expectations that would feel disastrous for not being met. I had already imagined finding my person and sharing my first ""New Years kiss"" (I am 25 and I've never been in a relationship that's been long enough to cross the New Years threshold). 

&amp;#x200B;

My friend's husband laughingly shared with the group of us that some woman tried to sneak a New Years Kiss from him and he had to turn away and reject her, and this dumb childish jealousy and all of my insecurity just bubbled up immediately. ""He's already married! He won! I'm the lonely single guy with a good job and my mental health is *improving*, I deserve random encounters like that!"" fucking stupid but it's all I feel in the moment and I have no choice but to react to it. Then this dark all-consuming feeling starts coming. It's a feeling I know way too well but I haven't been acquainted with for a while. It's an impulse that medication has helped to dull. I knew that I was too tired to fight it in my current state of mind, so I mustered up some energy to fake it for a few more minutes and then abruptly said goodbye to my friends and left. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel split. I still feel empowered by understanding a little more of what's going on internally, but I either forgot about or simply blocked out the cold lonely black hole that lives inside of me. The part that doesn't want ""I will never find love"" to be my answer, and the part that I was able to keep away by accepting the possibility of that being my reality. I told a psychic at the event ""I think I might never be in a real relationship"" and I meant it. I might still mean it, but every time that belief brings me relief I fall right back into a trap again. If it means not having to deal with that black hole that does nothing but eat time and emotion away from me while I wallow in misery and think about things over and over then maybe it's worth it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another part of me is glad to get a little bit of an ""episode"" in while I'm at least partially focused on improving, dissecting, and actually making steps towards overcoming this shit. I watched a video recently where a pwBPD showed a clip of her during what she called ""an episode"" and I was thinking ""what the hell is a BPD episode,"" and right now having been re-introduced to An Episode where over the course of half an hour I feel overwhelming emotion, feel compelled to take immediate and decisive action (luckily it turned out to be separating myself from the situation instead of impulsively drinking more and letting my emotional state deteriorate), and go through a roller coaster of ""this is good""-""this is confirmation of everything I am afraid of""-""I can improve""-""Who are you kidding"" I'm glad that I am at least at a state where I can be mindful of what my mind is actually doing.

&amp;#x200B;

It's easy to ""think healthy"" when you are in a ""safe"" situation. But it's a skill, I think, and you only get better when you practice. But since what really matters is to ""think healthy"" in an ""unsafe"" situation, I feel like the best way to practice is by being in mildly ""unsafe"", yet controlled, situations. From that perspective I think this is all good for me in the long run. Here's to cautious optimism for the new year. Love to all of you and good luck!"
1,"i wish i had friends with bpd! i just saw a picture of my fp and instinctively went ""i hate myself i hate myself i hate myself"" and contemplated suicide bc of the insane attachment/dependence i have on him but i couldn't rant about this to any of my friends bc 1) they'd just think i'm crazy without the context that i have bpd 2) if they knew i had bpd they'd still think i'm batshit crazy but they'd have something to pin it on and 3) i don't have any friends that have bpd and would understand

1,"Happy New Year I'm struggling, and I'm hopeless... but I wish everyone a better year than my 2018."
1,"My MIL just told me that my FIL tried to rape her last night... I don't know how to react to this and I'm trying really hard to keep my shit together but I'm really freaking out inside We stopped at my in-laws house to wish them a happy new year and while my SO was talking to his dad in the other room my MIL told me he got wasted last night and tried to rape her... I told her I was so sorry, and I really feel like that just wasn't enough; but it was all I could manage to choke out.. I didn't want to make a scene (she'd been speaking in hushed tones like she wanted this to stay between us), and they were walking back into the room almost immediately after she told me. I quickly shifted the conversation back to her needing to tell her therapist everything as soon as she can... Before we left she hugged me, and said I'm the only one who knows what happened... I tried to get out the door ahead of my SO, to get away before my FIL noticed I didn't say goodbye to him. I wasn't fast enough. I heard ""she's not going to get away without a hug"", and my heart sank right as I felt myself being pulled into the most stomach churning hug I think I've had in my life. 

My (61)FIL is a creep... But I really didn't want to believe that he was this much of one... And what can I do about it??? My (54)MIL is not stable, but will not leave him no matter how bad things get. She's always had her own mental health issues, but he exacerbates them with his constant mistreatment that can (clearly) get outright abusive. 

I'm typing this while my SO is in the other room... I don't want him to have to bear this burden... I wish I didn't have to either... I'm really not even in a good place with my own mental health, so how am I supposed to help anyone when I've never even been able to help myself?

Fuck..."
1,I think theres a fine line between splitting and.... Not wanting to talk to a mean asshole anymore.  Amirite?

1,"Help me get back to my ex # Background

My ex-girlfriend, Clara, has BPD, and subscribes to Taoism. Most people would know about Taoism via the yin-yang, but actual its core teachings are about social harmony, acting spontaneously, and avoiding conceptualization. However, as with anything else, there are misconceptions and extremes that you have to be careful. In Clara case, these misconceptions nurture the disorder, and the core values of Taoism help her navigate in life. Because on the surface she is sharp and reasonable, a therapist cannot work out without having a solid understanding on Taoism.

^(Just to get you a feel for the problem, for example, she admitted that she doesn't understand herself (a typical problem of BPD). But when I talked about that, she used a teaching of Taoism to defend: a wise person is the one who knows nothing; you don't see me understand myself because you don't get that knowing is not knowing, and not knowing is knowing. I think even an expert in BPD would be confused before this.)

Therefore, insight played a crucial role in our relationship, if not the only one, and to grasp it I must have a long, stable time to research. I could assure her that I loved her, but for me claiming something without a solid understanding of it was unacceptable. I was so afraid to be wrong, even know deep down I knew I was right. Seeing there was no point to continue the relationship, 2 years ago I terminated it so that I can make it better the next time. She accepted my offer to end the relationship immediately.

I know you're gonna say ""2 years are long, people change, your logic is flawed, get over her already"". Again, I think if insight is provided then the eager to continue will be naturally provoked, no matter what. And plus, in those years I didn't all live in rumination and resentment, but expanded my knowledge and core values. My therapist was really confused for never seeing someone so sane like me (that's her words) and should have get over her long ago.

I have consulted my friend, and she agrees that Clara will come back (with around 70% of confidence, because she doesn't know Clara in person). Here are the points that I can convince her:

* She is a big fan of Zhuangzi (a Taoist philosopher), and it was her to say that I was like Zhuangzi, when I knew nothing about him.
* She wished that she could have the courage to face her fears, but she couldn't. If I want to be her role model, I must prove that with logic one can fear nothing.
* She said that she wanted to know the difference between real love and pseudo-love. With the new understanding I can now answer that question.
* She wished that she could have had an attitude to life as simple as mine. I had it, but I couldn't explain why I had it, or knew how to transfer it to other people. Now I hope I can do that now.
* From the last time I checked her (November), she was still the same, and hasn't found a suitable partner.

I have some options to contact her, but to be sure I want you to check if there are holes I don't see, and hear more advices from you.

# Options 

## Ask a friend

Mary is an important friend of Clara, and she was one of the person Clara announcing our relationship when we just dated. In her replies (Clara screenshotted and sent to me, because she didn't know how to express her feeling on me), Mary said that she was so happy that Clara found a person who could make her that happy; in previous relationships even when she was with other men her face was still sad.

When we broke up and I moved to her city to understand her culture, Clara brought me to Mary's home to visit her newborn daughter. In her home Mary witnessed Clara's rage on me. I don't say much at there.

I think the lines I will message her would be:

&gt;Hello Mary. I am Ooker who once visited your home when your baby was born. It was Clara who brought me there. I have finally understood her, and can provide what she needs. Do you want to talk?

I think this promises the best outcome, but I'm not sure if she's busy or overwhelming with her work right now, or she has deactivated her account. It would be much harder to explain via chat than face-to-face (we lives in different cities).

## Create another Facebook account and comment

The advantage of this is that I can do that in context. However, my knowledge works best if there is a conflict or an extreme view that relates to the philosophy. They can appear in the conversations of other persons, but not really in the post.

## Text her directly

I think I'll send her this:

&gt;Actually being Zhuangzi is pretty easy. There are a lot of them in the internet.

My reasoning is that for a person who sees Zhuangzi as a guiding role, and always compares others with him, then hearing that what they are looking for is everywhere is surprising. But I'm not sure if this would work.

Another variation of this is to send her a file synthesizing all I know about BPD and Taoism, perhaps sent via Mary or to her directly. I have the draft, but the ideas are still unconnected, and each complete ideas will feel authoritative. This authoritativeness is a part of the style from Taoist texts, and can be what a person with BPD looking for when they are confusing, but it can be perceived as being aggressive in normal mood. If each of them is used individually then perhaps it's better.

**Other contact information I have:** her home address (which her mom lives, but not her), her dad's number. I have talked to them personally, and they all have positive views on me.

Thanks again for your reading. I appreciate it."
1,"New Year I'm not a fan of the ""New Year, New Me"" bullshit but I pray that 2019 brings us all some self love and self improvement so we can become the versions of ourselves that others don't believe we can be because of BPD.

1,"I had an actual good night. So I have bpd, major depressive disorder, and acute anxiety and was invited to a party of 8 only knew one person for the last 3 days. I thought I would either get wasted and cry on everyone or everyone was going to ignore me and I'd be on the verge of tears but something happened. Everyone here clicked with me somehow and were so inclusive and kind and fun. I talked and laughed with everyone and got 3 midnight kisses and a whole new set of friends after having none.  The guy I went with even said I was amazing and that he wanted to help me get back on my feet with a job offer! I'm proud of myself for going and socializing with the right people:')"

1,"Was just wanting to enjoy the last few weeks of my life I'm such a mess right now that I don't think that I can even fill this post coherently, but I'm going to try. 

I've been suicidal and depressed for as long as I can remember -- my life has been one instance of holding and pulling myself together after the next. I have grown immensely tired. I don't want to live any more.

I have known that I am going to kill myself for some time now. My s/o, FP, whatever you want to call them, goes to school across the country. I was planning on having a few amazing weeks with her while she was visiting on break before I finally did the deed -- and even now things have gone to shit. She went to a NYE party without even inviting me, just another reality check. Don't get me wrong, she invited me after she knew that I was upset about not spending NYE with her, but that's not the point. I don't want to go along because she realized after the fact, I wanted to be in her mind all along. Anyways, small potatoes in the grand scheme of things.

I am not okay. I have not been okay in a long time. I am finally at peace with letting everything go -- I have nothing left to hold on to. I have no money, I can't work. I am not originally from America, and I lost my Certificate of Citizenship when my car got stolen. My fee waiver got denied, and I don't even have the 600 bucks required to get a new one, meaning I can't prove my right to work. I'm in limbo.

I'm literally a sinking ship, and with everything else I have going on mentally, I don't want to go on. I seek solace, I want peace.

Anyways, sorry for burdening you guys. I hope you all find your way in this world. I am just looking for my way out.

1,"The fear of abandonment is so real tonight To keep this less obvious because my friends use Reddit, I clearly tipped the scale for a second tonight having an emotional episode over something small. 

Someone left the room and it made me realize how easily I can and do push people away. I’ll eventually be alone forever. "
1,"Betrayal sucks, and I don’t understand people I’m not sure where exactly to post this, but I feel pretty safe in this sub. I honestly have no one to really vent to. Please go easy on me. 

We all know the holidays means having to spend time with family. Although I spent time with my SO’s awesome family, a really weird thing started happening the past two weeks. I thought a had a friend in someone, let’s call her S. She and I were close, and I was (as she told me) her only female friend. Likewise. So we went out together, we supported each other through tough times, like my suicidal thoughts and her cheating husband, and I really thought “wow maybe this really will be a friendship that lasts. 

Well, lol and behold, I was wrong. So very very wrong. I start noticing somethings off with her and the way she treats me an y service dog, ever since I decided against filing for disability. She exploded at me, finally, about 2 weeks ago. The gist of it was that she didn’t like my dog around (fine I guess not everyone likes certain breeds) and that I am a bitch for expecting people to put up with me because I decided not to file. So in her mind, because I decided not to file (with my awesome lawyer dad who adopted me guiding me through this) that I should magically stop being disabled, and magically stop needing help, and stop expecting people to be nice to me or put up with me or accommodate me or my dog. That really hurt, I thought she understood what my conditions are. We stopped talking after that.

Tonight for New Years we all meet up at my SO’s aunts house. S is the wife of his brother, so naturally she is there, along with her yappy little dog who is unbelievably badly behaved. It’s no secret, everyone in the family know about that poor little dog, and everyone in the family has tried convincing them to put in actual effort to train the dog. When I say badly behaved, I mean he will pee on the couch while you’re watching tv, and jump all over you, and bark nonstop. I know it’s not the dogs fault, it’s the owners fault. So here we are, my service dog and her uncontrollable dog. My dog, Dante, is well trained. He can patiently lay down while all the fireworks are going on, and he tries his hardest to focus while their dog is around, but really... who could resist a loud little dog trying to jump all over you while barking in your ear? So Dante can’t handle that, that’s too much, and I can’t expect him to be okay with that. But if I touch their dog, they yell at me. So I ask them to please leash their dog, since I leashed mine. Then hell broke loose. They yelled at me, insulted my worth basically, and let their dog keep roaming. 

So now I’m sitting outside by the lake while everyone else is inside having a good time. I’m alone out here with Dante, and it really hurts to start the new year this way. It really hurts that someone would deny reason and logic. “My dog is interfering with a service dog. I should control my dog”- that literally did not compute for S and her husband. It’s cold and it’s lonely and it’s dark and I feel ashamed for having my issues, needing a dog, and just being alive. I wish I could stop existing right now. 

Thanks for listening. I feel a little less alone now that I’m posting this. "
1,"Does anyone else get abandoned by friends without explanation? This has happened to me since I was in middle school. I’ve tried so hard to self reflect and try to figure out what I’m doing wrong, and I can’t seem to figure it out. I think I’m kind, nice and always try to make my friends feel good. But my friends have always slowly separated themselves from me. First it starts by making excuses not to hang out, then they just completely cut me off. This has happened with at least 10 different people since I was 15 and I’m 24 now. Even friends who have sworn they love and care for me so much and promised they’d always be in my life. "

2,"Hallucinations occurring frequently (NSFW) (Marked NSFW due to potentially triggering content)

Just a little backstory. I've suffered from PTSD since I was 10 years old (I'm nearly 20 now) and diagnosed with PTSD when I was 18. For years, I would have nightmares where I would relive the experience, which seems pretty common. When I got to about 14, I would go about 2 or 3 days without sleeping to avoid these nightmares because I didn't know how to cope with them. When I would go 2 or 3 days without sleeping, I would often hear laughter, incoherent whispers that weren't real or the sound of someone hitting a metal object next to my head when I was alone. It was pretty easy for me to just write it off as the result of sleep deprivation and go about my day even if I found it horrifying. In more recent years, the nightmares have become a lot more sporadic and don't occur as often. I cope with the nightmares the next day with meditation when they do happen. Because I haven't gone several days without sleeping for a few years, I've been free of these hallucinations for quite some time.

The dilemma I'm in now feels a lot more serious than when I was deprived of sleep. About a month or two ago, I had experienced one of these flashback nightmares that I've been having for almost a decade. Early the next day, I began meditating. Everything was going as planned until about 20 minutes in. At this point, I was hearing a man speaking aggressively in French (much like Jacques Brel, but the voice sounded deeper). I'm not fluent in French, so whatever I was hearing is a mystery. The next day a similar thing happened after a nightmare except this time it sounded like a low-flying airplane was in my head. It was loud enough to scare me out of meditation and make my heart race. 

The nightmares have been less frequent since then. I have, however, been experiencing more straightforward hallucinations. Every few hours or so, I'll see a humanoid figure in the corner of my eye. Like someone is behind me watching me. More recently I've also been seeing shadow-like figures running around right in front of me. The other night I was in my girlfriend's room watching a show with her when I noticed in the other corner of the room a shadowy figure in the corner of my eye. I couldn't focus on it enough to make out any features, but I did my best to make sure I really saw something. When I finally glanced over, it was gone. She knew something was up, as I seemed distracted (or maybe she sensed my terror) and asked me what was wrong. I just said I thought I saw something. 

I'm afraid to come forward about all of this to anyone in my everyday life. I'm afraid people may think there's something wrong with me. I just need someone to verify that this is normal with PTSD and not another mental illness. I'd also appreciate any anecdotes or advice. Thank you in advance. This has just been scary. I felt like I was doing well for so long. "

2,"Advice on medications and therapy I have been struggling for PTSD for 6 years. It's destroyed me and the personalty I used to have. I'm a very angry, paranoid, and bitter person now. I'm not who I was 10 years ago and I honestly don't think I will ever be that man again.

For the last 4 years I've been self medicating with alcohol every day to feel calm and not so keyed up and paranoid. 

I was able to quit successfully on my own, I've been sober 16 days today. Not one drink (this was not easy at all)

But I'm struggling now more then I ever have, My PTSD seems worst then I remember it being before I started drinking to manage it. 

I'm angry, paranoid, anxious, depressed, and hypervigilant to the point of near exhaustion. I just feel like giving up and going back to drinking. I feel like these feelings will never go away and I can't function like this, I either need relief by using alcohol again or I need to see a doctor. 

The problem is I'm very paranoid of people and their intentions and I do not trust doctors at all, I also am apprehensive about telling them everything (or anything for that matter) because I feel like they won't keep things between us. I can't repeat the things that cause me hurt and pain to myself, Let alone another person who does not understand what I've been though and had to do. 

Deep down I do want to get all those things off my chest but I'm afraid to talk about them. I also don't like being stigmatized as crazy or weak because I am a man. I was raised in a very conservative household and I was taught not to cry, show weakness, or talk about trivial things like how I'm feeling or how things make me feel so talking about feelings is very alien to me. I just don't know if I can tell someone I don't know or trust everything.

I've considered just going to a psychiatrist instead of a therapist so I don't have to talk about anything. 

I just want relief from these feelings. 

If anyone has combat induced PTSD, Can you give me advice on what medications to ask for?

Any advice would be great.

Thank you"

2,"Seriously struggling I have severe C PTSD due to unrelenting traumas throughout my life.

I have a bunch of debt, no sense of self, university dropout and no idea what I want in life. 

The only thing I want to do is travel but I don't make enough. I want to backpack Europe but even for that I'd need a good few thousand. 

Today, I got fired from my job. I wasn't the best employee but I spoke french and English which most others couldn't and I we had occasional french customers, I was early, I was fast on the cash register, I followed the dress code and didn't stand around talking for 40 mins where most others barely did that... managers included.. 

There were 4 managers and I had no problem with the first 3. The 4th one was a narc that totally triangulated the other 3 against me and I noticed a shift in their attitudes towards me after she decided to have a vendetta against me. She would constantly minimize me, be passive aggressive, push only my breaks back but no one else's and nit pick me to a T. Other employees agreed that they saw this happening. 

Today I woke up feeling amazing after a deep sleep meditation on YouTube- only to get fired as they told me right before my shift. This really shook me and made my PTSD worse and I've felt like crap all day today... It was the only thing that helped me build motivation, my job. It's this constant cycle of me barely surviving and then other people tearing me apart. 

Ive suffered severe attachment traumas. I have never had parents there for me, never had true friends, never had a boyfriend or a true love interest in my life. I've been used by narcissists sexually, mentally and emotionally. My mom has used my mind against me. I can't find real friends. I can't even connect to my
True self it seems. 

I just don't know what to do. I'm in this trance like fog state and I can't think right. I need to get away from the narc mom I live with but I don't make enough and now being fired I definitely don't make enough.

I guess I should look for a new more full time job but it's really hard keeping a job because I keep a) attracting narcissists who can't be pleased or b) my depression and PTSD gets perceived as bitchiness/ laziness, despite that I do try. 

I guess being on meds would help but I don't know the necessary steps to obtain them without family doctor  ( I live in Ontario Canada) 

I was on risperidone for a bit when they thought I had schizophrenia but I don't have schizophrenia and risperidone just made me twitch/feel foggy/anxiety seared through the roof that I thought I was literally about to die/ and so on and I've read awful things about risperidone anyway. 

It appears I also have super low self confidence/internalized hatred for myself there for I feel guilty when I embrace myself as if I always owe people something and I seek my confidence in external circumstances that always come crumbling down due to narcissists. "
2,"My startle response is extreme and I need some tips on how to cope.. So I live with my mom (no job because of an eating disorder and flashbacks, but am getting help for the flashbacks soon and already for the ed) and sometimes when I take a nap, she knocks on the door and opens it and it scares the hell out of me. I'll scream at her and swear. It's like I can't control it. I'm always on guard. 

Any tips? I've told my mom about my assault and I said please not to barge in my room like that because my mind thinks she is my attacker and she really invalidated me like ""oh come on, I'm not your attacker, you are safe here!"" :/ so if she won't stop, I need tips on how to stop being a bitch..."
2,"How to know which therapist is good or not? I'm finally able to afford EMDR therapy, barely.

I found a place in my area that seems pretty good, but has no reviews online.

Hell, most therapists / centers in my area, especially for PTSD, have either no reviews or little reviews online.

Being broke, I don't want to have to throw down $XXX amount of money for someone that isn't good or that I won't work well with. Maybe I just have to get over that aspect of finding a therapist and figure I might need to see two or three before I land a good one?

Anyone have experience with this?"
2,"Rough night after college orientation NSFW 

I need to vent to someone who understands. 

I have C-PTSD from prolonged childhood trauma. It’s been a terrible struggle to keep my shit together and live as normal of a life as I can.  Several years ago I attempted to go to school to get my degree. 

There, I was raped and beat up at a party. This triggered a downward spiral that led to a suicide attempt that got me kicked out of school. I lost my job, my relationship and ended up homeless for a while. I was a wreck and unable to keep even a simple restaurant job. 

I’ve spent the last few years clawing my way out of this pit. I forced myself to get through a shitty retail job even if it meant vomiting and crying every day before work. It was fucking hell. I only made it due to the kindness of some wonderful people. Sheer gratitude that someone cared enough to try to help me gave me what I needed to make it. 

Today, I have a career I am proud of. I am almost entirely out of debt. I am in a healthy and stable relationship. Until tonight I felt like I was finally moving on with my life. 

Today, I took a big step and decided to go back to school and take one class. Part of enrollment involves watching a graphic video about sexual assault, harassment and domestic abuse. 

I was completely taken off guard by how upset this video made me. I started sobbing in the middle of Starbucks. It was humiliating. 

My partner was really sweet and made me feel a bit better with a mix of r/corgi videos and hugs. But I just can’t shake it. I’m shaking right now. I am having flash backs and intense hyper vigilant reactions. 

I feel like someone just kicked me off a ledge and I am so angry. I’m angry that this is the establishments response to the nightmare I went through. I am angry that I was dismissed and discarded in my time of need. I am angry that I am forced to relive it as part of the price of admission to get my life back. And most of all, I am angry at myself for being so fragile. I am scared that everything I have worked for could be gone in an instance and I could be back on the street. I don’t know what to do. "
2,"Triggers and flashbacks 🙁 The fact that I didn’t even think of this until the evening of New Years Day is progress, I suppose. 

For my first job after college, I worked with a nonprofit in a third world country. Several of my American peers in this location discovered that I had never been in a relationship and never been kissed. There were good reasons - I’d spent much of my teens in the hospital, plus I was very committed to waiting for the right guy. 

Anyway, they decided that, this New Year’s Eve, they were going to get me my first kiss. “Everyone should get a kiss on New Years!” they said. “Go to the porch on XYZ building and we will arrange for the cutest guy we can find to come and kiss you!”

I stupidly got swept up in their excitement, and I agreed. 

On New Years Eve, I went to the porch on XYZ building. I waited. 

And up wandered a creepy old guy we worked with. He was easily old enough to be my grandfather. He was not attractive in any way. 

I turned and ran. I got back to my bunk, and when I entered my cabin, my friends (who had all been waiting there) burst out laughing. They just thought this had been the funniest thing imaginable. 

Then they got pissed at me for being angry at them. Why couldn’t I enjoy a harmless prank?

It’s been several years since then. I’ve grown, my ptsd has improved, my life is better... but man, when I remember that night, I still get so angry at them. 

They taught me that I’m not worth respecting, and that no one will ever want to kiss me. Those are hard lessons to unlearn. I can’t understand why they would do that. "

2,"Sleep Paralysis and PTSD: Unwelcome Truth Realized Hey everyone,

I was diagnosed with PTSD because I grew up in a very abusive home with drug addicts and alcoholics. My family is very twisted so I avoid them at all cost but my mother recently revealed that I ""may have been"" (her words) sexually assaulted by my uncle, who molested her. I witnessed him attempt to molest her when I was younger, so I don't doubt this.

He was a very abusive to my family (we lived with him on/off till I was 15) because he was a mean drunk and would cut phone cords and start physical fights with my grandparents and my mom. I remember he used to tie me up with duct tape and cover my mouth and would keep me in his room. I don't remember if anything happened but after my experience with sleep paralysis - I'm kind of messed up and feel like I do remember now. 

I hope I am making sense because I am on high-alert right now.

I felt my mind wake up but I couldn't move my body. I felt like something was in the room and it was trying to confine/take me with blankets. I felt it actually trying to confine me. I felt its hands touching me. At first, I thought it was little gremlins, but then I thought of my uncle, and I attempted to scream for help. I kept trying to move my body but I was stuck.

It's been 4 hours since that happened and I am terrified and I feel violated and sick. I'm not sure what is going on. But I feel alone, sad, scared, and like I don't want to try anymore. I just feel so sick and confused and like an epiphany exploded in my head. 

I don't know what I am expecting but I don't have anyone to talk to who will understand.   

"
2,"How is it discussed in counseling? My counselor doesn't like to talk about labels too much. I can appreciate that considering I've had periods of wondering if I'm a hypochondriac or munchausen while spending years jumping hospital systems trying to get a diagnosis for my pain and nausea.

Part of my trauma, though, was not having a label. Being a sick, non functional adult while being told I'm normal, healthy. Burying the physical strain and mental toll to the point where the pain has manifested itself in a physical form (fibromyalgia pain).

So I'm out here again, searching for what is the norm, what I should expect. How do you and your counselor address how your life is influenced on a daily basis by this? 

Am I just not ready? 

I guess I just feel like things aren't being addressed and I don't know how to change the track, yet again."
2,"I feel like such a child [Rant] [NSFW] **Throwaway because I'm scared of friends knowing from username, potentially triggering rant (SH).**



**Background**: I was the victim of an armed robbery in mid-2016 at 1 AM walking less than 3 blocks from my home and was held at gunpoint.  I had been walking home from a friend's place and was with another friend at the time, we even made sure to walk on a well lit and well used street but as we were stopped at an intersection the two men approached us and had asked for directions to the metro station (the direction we were headed), I had a horrible feeling immediately and told them that we didn't know but that a stop was just up the road the other way (which is true).  After about 15 seconds of silence my friend and I started to turn around when they rushed up to us and pulled out a gun.  I'm only like 5'7"" and the taller man of the two was easily 6'2"" and he grabbed my left shoulder and held the gun to my stomach and demanded our bags and wallets.  We gave them everything (I was able to hide my phone which later let us call 911) and after handing it all over they kept the gun on me and I was sure I was about to be shot.  Luckily they took of running and once they rounded a corner we ran away too.  It was absolutely the worst thing to ever happen to me.  The police never were able to find the suspects and the robberies in my area have unfortunately gone up this past year, I also only went to therapy for about 2 weeks following the incident but I was just so sick of retelling the story and felt like nothing was helping so I stopped.

Fast forward and now I feel like such a child because I can't seem to get over it.  I literally just last night was less than 50 feet outside of my apartment smoking and suddenly felt like I was going to be ambushed and even though I knew there are guards on the property and knew nothing was going to happen I just started crying and had to run up to my apartment.  I can't even walk at night anymore without feeling anxious and I'm constantly on alert and just fucking despise myself for it.  I go to university and avoid studying on campus because I don't want to have to walk at night back to my car so I can drive less than a mile home since I will never walk home at night again.  I feel like such weakling like I'm pathetic and scared of the dark and I fucking hate myself for not just calling an uber that night.  I've literally been startled by my own shadow I'm such a coward and I can't bring myself to admit to my friends or those around me how often I'm scared by the most childish things once it gets dark out.  To make matters worse the realization that I likely have PTSD has just worsened my depression since I blame myself for letting it get this out of hand because I should've been fucking staying in therapy like my parents wanted me to but I just wanted to stop talking about it so bad that I decided I'd just completely stop talking about it like it never happened.  Obviously that's unfolded as well as it always does and I feel so dumb because I did this to myself I could've taken steps to prevent this and I just fucking couldn't because I was too weak to let therapy hurt for a bit.  

Another episode that just fucks with my to today was in October when I went to a party I lost my wallet for a short time.  I was sent into a horrible panic attack and felt so embarrassed and stupid and blamed myself for letting this all happen.  One thing led to another and the negative thought spiral just had me back thinking about the robbery and how all I do is make life harder for myself and those who care about me by doing stupid shit like walking home at night or losing my wallet and it ended in a night of cutting it was ridiculous.  And of course my friends found my wallet the very next night and it was like nothing happened and all I could think was that I deserved it because I am just this stupid burden who can't keep his shit together.

I know therapy has to be my next step but my family has a medical emergency at the moment with a cancer diagnosis and I feel like I'm going to dissappoint them by revealing how bad I've let my mental health deteriorate to the point of this just constant anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideations.  I feel like therapy is just going to do nothing for me unless they drug me up and then I'm just lying to myself that things are getting better everything is still going to be as bad I'm just going to be paying for someone to pretend to care about me and give me pills.

Sorry this rant has basically no fucking point but I'm just so done with myself and I hate myself for letting this happen and doing this to myself and just need to vent.

**TLDR: Got robbed at gunpoint mid-2016 and still am not over it.  Haven't felt safe at night since, constantly vigilant, can't study on campus because I don't want to walk at night, and just basically haven't felt safe since.  The past few months my depression has just crept up and gotten so bad I want to just kill myself every day for being the pathetic child I've become.  Feel like I've let my mental health deteriorate and getting help isn't going to do anything but let my family know I'm a disappointing liar who can't keep his shit together and hasn't been honest about anything I've felt since then.**

2,"Someone loves you I tried to take my life again yesterday. Took a few bars and chugged it down with beer before someone stopped me. I remember being carried to the car, a nurse putting me in a wheelchair and trying to rip out my IV. I got sick of being so scared of everything. 

My therapist tells me I have abandonment problems because of my trauma. That I’d rather snap at people and drive them away than be abandoned again. 

I have trouble believing most days that anyone cares about me. This condition has made me believe that I’m somehow unlovable and alienated from the rest of the world, and that any emotional interaction I have with another person is them taking pity on me. I think a lot of us feel that disconnection. 

Maybe someone is in the spot I was last night and if so, I just wanted to let you know that I love you. Someone cares. Love languages are a strange thing and it’s not always obvious, but there’s a strand of hope out there in ways that we cannot yet fathom. But it’s there. Even if it’s this post you’ve read. 

Keep going. Someone loves you. "
2,"EMDR has started messing up my sleep, or is it? Official diagnosis is c-ptsd. Full-blown PTSD for more than 25 years. Started EMDR about six months ago, Stellar results. Very pleased with my progress. I've gotten through three specific traumatic events in EMDR, and this last one is not going as smoothly as the first two. I cannot stay in REM sleep, I wake up with fevers or hot flashes and a racing mind. I no longer have night terrors or nightmares, so that's a plus. But I'm having intense physical stress reactions that are causing extreme fatigue, arthritis, fibromyalgia, and random suppressed immune system things like shingles. From what I've read, long-term untreated PTSD can wear your body down to the point where you experienced a lot of these illnesses. Has anyone else had worse sleep after EMDR? I was expecting it to get better. I'm wondering if it has to do with a combination of processing through one of the biggest core traumas and just the fact that my body is worn out."

2,"It Took So Many Years I’ve been seeing therapists and psychiatrists for the past 6 years. For 6 years each and every psychiatrist would come up with their own diagnosis of what’s wrong with me. I’ve been labeled with traits of psychosis, border personality disorder, Bipolar, Depressive bipolar, and now finally, PTSD. 
I’ve finally found a doctor that was actually willing to listen and cooperate with my therapist to find the perfect diagnoses. One single disorder and that was PTSD. 
I took it as a shock at first. I didn’t understand how I could have PTSD? I always assumed that only veterans suffered from it. I’m still learning about it. Learning my triggers and my good and bad days. 
My biggest trigger is family. I can’t deal with my family after enduring years of physical, sexual and mental abuse. 
It’s so hard to stay away from them and cut ties. I’ve moved out of my home country and relocated all the way to the United States just to get some distance. Yet they never fail to find ways to manipulating me.

2,"Trigger warning. It's been an awful day. I don't know that I'm looking for advice, but I need to just get this out.

I'm not currently in therapy, and I know that's what a lot of the responses will be. The short answer is I'm newly insured, and I'm working on it.

I have some sexual trauma in my past, and today I had to see a doctor regarding some of the physical health problems that trauma has caused me. I wasn't prepared. I thought I could go in and just lay it out, and be on my merry way, but apparently the dreaded physical and pap exam was necessary. It was awful. Truly awful it wasn't the doctors fault. She was very compassionate and made sure she laid out the least invasive options, and told me I could tell her to stop, and warned me of what she was doing. She did everything right. But I still froze and cried through the entire thing. Some of the sensations brouvht me to memories of old sensations, andI felt really vulnerable, trapped, and ashamed, and I haven't been able to shake it off all day.

Part of it is that we have company staying in our home; so I don't feel like I have the space to care for myself, and it just further perpetuates the shame feeling. In fact, I felt too ashamed to go home right after, and drove around for an hour and a half before I felt like I at least i wouldn't have to explain myself to my boyfriend's family.

Additionally, because it's my boyfriend's family, my boyfriend has been unavailable to me all day. He came to bed, and asked if I was okay, but he fell asleep in the middle of me trying to describe how I'm not.  I tried to vent to the one friend that I trust with this stuff, but she was busy. I tried a listener on seven cups, and was told to just not worry about it before I could even get it all out. So im throwing this out here as a rant. If anyone has kind words, i would appreciate them, but mostly i just needed to dump it out into the universe somewhere before it swallows me whole.

Also, if anyone has any solid advice on how to successfully get through gynecological exams, that would be actually well appreciated."

2,"How can i help my 16year old friend with PTSD Hey folks so heres the deal,

Background: my 16 year old friend just came out about sexual and physical abuse from her asshole father 2 months ago. There is an ongoing complex intense court battle between the 2 of them and her family (who admittedly have always been distant) have chosen to side with the father and isolate/ostracize my friend. She has been on and off again homeless, and because of this, she made the healthy decision to move in with me and has become apart of my family. 
I love my friend, she desperately wants to overcome this but is struggling with a lot of symptoms, and myself and my parents want to learn how to help her any way we can. 
She has these dreams where she wakes up panicking and sweating. Last time she told me that she couldnt stop going over what happened in her head, and although i stayed with her, it took a long time for her to fall back asleep.
She also has flashbacks where she goes in and out of the present and past. For example last week after volleyball she was triggered by the noisy change room and ended up standing in the corner unresponsive to anyone repeating the words ""its my fault"". I ended up getting her alone away from the rest of the team but i need strategies on how to get her out of the flashback. Ive noticed that when shes a present the hypersensitivity kicks in and everythings crazy loud for her but then she cant hear anything when shes back in her flashback. Sometimes it helps to give a hug or hold her hand sometimes it terrifies or irritates her. I dont know how to get her out of it and i hate to see her that terrified. 
The hypersensitivity can be super hard too around the house, sometimes shes able to say that something like the dryer is too loud otherwise we'll find her in the corner of her room with her head between her legs in a panic attack. 
We desperately want strategies to help bring her out of a flashback/dissociation, panic attack, night terrors and just the general feeling of loneliness and betrayal she deals with daily. Also note we just started her with a counsellor who she says is helping a lot, this is just for at home and school. Really and insight into ptsd would be super helpful as were all still trying to comprehend it.

For now, it's Thot Magic.^TM"
2,"I set myself back by thinking I could ask for help. And back to square 1 now... I was diagnosed with PTSD, Anxiety, Depression etc, etc after I came out of a coma from a failed suicide attempt in 2014. Many things/instances led me down the path I am currently on... childhood abuse (physical, sexual, mental) onto a lifetime of abuses (again physical, sexual, mental) and other tragedies mixed in like the death of my daughter...

Well, onto my current issue.. I had deactivated Facebook when I got out of the hospital. Besides that my memory was mush, people on that account had known what was occurring, contributed to or even blamed me for ""letting myself be tortured "". So it was wise to end communication....

I recently went back onto that account to ask for help. I had created a gofundme account as living on disability sucks, and I needed a little help to start earning my own money again. (I have a separate Facebook I just opened 7mo ago for family only and have been fine with that).

So with getting back on this old account, I was reading comments like ""if there is anything I can do to help"", so I thought I would give it a try... while trying to ignore the post from the woman who had an affair with my husband calling me a ""dear friend"" while I was in a coma and could not lose my ever loving mind on her.

You can guess where this is going... I am back to being ANGRY, HURT, BETRAYED , and a very unhealthy dose of self hatred /loathing constantly. These are people who knew what was going on, the pain I was in and still in and are seriously responding with things like ""glad things are going good for you"".

I am accustomed to not being heard when I speak, cry or beg for mercy... why was I such a fool to tell these people I am still suffering? Why did I try for help? Why did I think they cared? Is my brain so muddled that I convinced myself I mattered to these people? 

And last but not least... why do people honestly wonder why I don't leave the house or interact with people IRL?

TLDR.. I was a fool and thought revisiting an old Facebook looking for help, only to be reminded why I had tried to end my life."
2,"being upset about getting therapy / help i had therapy sessions years ago surrounding my childhood sexual abuse and other childhood traumas but i felt like there wasn't much progress. all it did was bring up the worst feelings i had in my life and let me suffer through that emotion again without any way of seeing there was path to healing. i didn't want to be put on medication either. on the 10th or 11th session, i walked out on my therapist and never came back. 


i still deal with PTSD like symptoms such as strong twitching when thinking about my past or very sad subjects. im especially sensitive to things like that. if im at work im distant from others and if left with time to wander in my thoughts, i will think about dark stuff and flinch very noticeably - and others might ask why i do that. it's embarrassing but at other times i feel completely okay, even happy, can function for days no problem. i even have the habit a bit contradictory to the sad thought flinch - just thinking of little jokes and i'll laugh out loud - and of course that's embarrassing to as i seem like a crazy person to my co-workers. i guess i have a strong pendulum of emotion and react strongly to it. other times its long bouts of apathy. 


so im thinking about getting therapy / help again. but even looking around on websites and thinking about getting that help upsets me. i flinch pretty hard but not even on certain hard memories, just vague memories of the multiple occasions when i had a bad time in my past. i think PTSD, if i really do have it, probably blurred my memory on certain bad things. i also can't find any good info on this stuff. i don't know if i should get therapy or not either - money is a problem for me and therapy brings out the worst emotions. i don't want to feel those bad emotions, its very painful. "
2,"I did not win today, but I’ll try again tomorrow. Perfect storm led to my girlfriend and I celebrating our sixth anniversary apart, and after an already shitty day, it has kinda put me into an old spiral. 

I’ll try my best tomorrow. Not everyday can be a win "
2,"How do you tell the person who caused your PTSD that you have PTSD because of them? So during therapy I recently got told that I have PTSD and Panic Disorder from my father being abusive to me emotionally and verbally, but also from watching him fight and beat on my mom, brother, and step-mother. 
I’m 24 now and my dad has been trying to fix things between us because I’ve been distant for awhile and he knows I was going to start therapy, so he is going to ask me how it’s going. He has BPD and very narcissistic (he denies these diagnosis’s and refuses to take medication) so he has issues with admitting how bad he was when I was younger and blames others for his actions... If he doesn’t hear from me about the diagnosis he will hear it from someone else. How do I tell the person who caused my PTSD that I have PTSD and they’re the reason why? Please help."
2,"Partner Committed Himself to a Psychiatric Hold and I'm Trying Very Hard 
My SO has been really distant with everyone he knows lately and it began to worry me and everyone else. I was speaking on his behalf because he didn't want to talk to anyone and ended up being his ""voice"". I hated it. It made me feel guilty and as if I was the problem but I pushed forward and tried supporting him none the less. He runs video game tournaments and the other day he told me he would be there. He told me he was there and starting everything and everything seemed normal until one of his friends messaged me asking where he was. I questioned him and he told me he was at his friend ""Jay's"" house. I stopped talking to him at that point seeing that I was furious.He knew how much I don't trust this person around him when he's unhappy and I always made it a point to never lie where I was, ever. No matter how angry or sad I was. I told him this and was trying to reationalize why I was still with him basically the entire night.

The next day he messaged me that he was at a crisis walk in center for feeling suicidal with ""Jay"". Guys, I wanted to be supportive so bad but for 3 years I've been trying to get him to go to a therapist. I felt fucking useless and unappreciated and every un- you could think of. I couldn't help but feel stoic and cold throughout him trying to explain. They eventually told him that he was being trasferred to a Psychiatric hold. Very similar to the type I was. Even if it was a low risk hold I felt it in my gut and terror set in.

Back when I was a teenager, I had a lot of issues stemming from chemical imbalances as well as how I grew up. I had a really bad break one day and ended up downing my exes mom's medication in his room. His mom (god bless her soul) got me to the  hospital she worked at and I was transferred to a rehabilitation center that dealt with severe trauma. I was initially on a 72 day hold converted 14 day hold due to my silence and uncooperation throughout the entire process. Honestly, they were some of the worst days of my life and it completely ruined hospitals for me. I don't only panic now a days. If I'm in a hospital, I get nauseous and throw up due to everything that happened while I was being held. It just brings back terrible memories and terrible people I met while there. 



I knew I had to go and see him at the hospital to make sure he was okay. I knew I had to support his first steps towards mental health and support his parents but holy shit. I broke. The fuck. Down. I cried with him because I love him of course. It hurt to see him so scared. I cried even harder in the car going home. I pulled over to a median on the freeway and just cried and screamed for what seemed to be forever because I felt so god damn terrible about having to still deal with things like this. I feel so guilty about not being 110% supportive of whats going on but I feel so fucking useless. No matter how much people say I'm helping, I feel so fucking selfish for wanting all of this shit to stop. 


Earlier in the day before all this, I felt like I was breaking down because I felt so lonely it physically hurt. It felt so intense and vivid and painful and I felt so hopeless. I've made so much effort trying to counteract my symptoms by trying to put myself out there and it didn't seem to work.. It made everything taste terrible.  I snapped and had to ask a friend if they felt any kind of loneliness that intense just so I could gauge what was normal and he tried but it felt like it wasn't remotely close. My day was already off at me wanting to accept a ""shooting in the woods"" invitation from some acquaintances so I could wander off with a gun and shoot myself where no one would find me. 

And then this happened.

I'm driving over for visiting hours now after trying to call his payphone 18 times today to no avail. I bought him a card and a stuffed animal considering thats what I got when I was in care. I don't know. I'm not ready for this. I feel so selfish I'm not fucking ready for this shit for the rest of my life.

I don't expect any advice really. I just needed to vent, but if anyone for some god forsaken reason has felt like this too, it would just be nice to know."
2,Does anyone else here smoke weed to help? Wondering what your guys thoughts are it's helped me massively.
2,"Hands On Again 3 or 4 months ago my boyfriend put his hands on me.  6 months pregnant and this guy had my face to the ground with his hand around neck leaving pretty red marks on dark skin.  As soon as he let me go I scoured away like a hurt puppy and started having a panic attack.  At least I think that’s what it was.  I found it hard to breath.  Each breathe was hard to catch and felt like my first after deep sea diving.  I was shaking, scared to believe this guy just hurt me.

Today that ‘panic’ feeling came back.  What started as a back and forth argument turned into him ‘playing around’ with me.  Him behind me, covered my mouth and nose and just pulled my face back and my neck was straining.  I panicked because I’m 35 weeks now and the baby started tightening in my belly.  I couldn’t really breath.  I tried pulling his hands back away from my mouth to tell him to stop but his weight pushed me down into the couch making things harder.  By the time I got him to let go he started to pat my back as I gasped for air like the first night.  He asked me if I was ok..  I was shaking and I just repeated the same words as I did before, “please just get away from me”.  

I think that was a ptsd moment - I don’t know.  But since then I can’t even stand to be in the same room as him.  He says he was playing around but I know that wasn’t a game.  I never felt so uncomfortable and scared other than the night he did put his hands on me and it was exact same feeling today.  That was the scariest part.  It felt like that night never ended and I was just at the peak of emotion. 

I know most of you will say ‘you need to leave’ or something obvious - yes I know.  But things aren’t that easy and than there’s a me that is holding on to a stupid fucking thread of hope that he, of all people, will change."
2,Scared to talk to people. I finally want to get out and do things with my life but I’m scared to talk to people. I feel so insecure and I’m constantly an anxious mess. Whenever people ask me questions I just freeze up and I can’t connect with anyone. I used to be fairly social but now I can’t even hold a conversation because I feel so empty headed and can’t express my emotions properly. I also have had a tbi which makes me feel like I’m stupid and I’m afraid of being mocked bc I can’t always think of the right thing to say. How can I start slowly becoming more sociable? 
2,"Would anyone be interested in a kik group for PTSD? Hello! :)

I've always been feeling a bit of a freak because of my symptoms but reading your posts here and talking with others with PTSD I have realized that I am not alone. This is what led me to decide to make a PTSD group on kik where people can share their experiences, give advice and make new friends who understand their pain. Would anyone be interested in something like this? 


EDIT: The group is ready! Search #TheCirclePTSD on kik to join"
2,"Has anyone else had thoughts of violence relating to their trauma? I've been having extreme urges to break into my old school where I experienced a lot of pretty horrible things, and I'm not looking for people to tell me not to do it, what I choose to do is my choice, but has anyone else ever had those sorts of urges, whether they relate to a person, or a place, or an object?"
2,"PTSD resulting from car accident. Was wondering if anyone had any advice for this. I got into a really bad accident about 9 years ago, and after nearly causing another accident a few days later after swerving when I saw an oncoming car I gave up driving. For about 2 years I could hardly get into a car without panicing. However, 9 years later, I have no problem getting into a car however I cannot fathom driving. Bad drivers still give me scares, but thats normal I'm sure. Most of my anxiety now comes from lack of self-confidence in driving, and imagining things like people running stop signs (someone ran a stop sign and hit me going 50 over the speed limit) at intersections. The inability to drive has deeply impacted my life and I would really like to get over the overwhelming anxiety that has limited me, so any advice or suggestions are welcome. For what its worth, anxiety has impacted me greatly in other aspects of life but this specific problem is rooted in a tramautic event."
2,"I feel like I'm not capable of love anymore Due to being psychologically abused by an ex (severely) in 2015, I haven't been the same since and I have yet to fall in love again. I have been in a couple of relationships but I have had no feelings for them. I have finally met someone who seems pretty amazing, and I have started to open up to him. But it's so hard for me to have feelings. It hurts me so bad to know that someone that fucked me over almost 3 years ago still has this power over me, that I'm unable to let it go and just love someone else."
2,There's a trauma AMA on r/traumatoolbox by professionals! Happening right now! Just thought you all should know. 
2,"[NFSW] [Vent] [Trigger Warning] Feel like I won't recover It's difficult to believe if you look at me normally, or the way I talk about my family. I love them a lot. I also attend a good university and am fairly successful there and in my work. However, when I was a child, according to my psychologist and I guess to myself, too, I was physically abused a lot. I remember being choked by one of my parents because she was angry with me. I remember getting bit. I remember being threatened to be thrown out of the house naked and my clothes being ripped off of me. I remember getting beaten up in front of one of our family friends. I remember getting cut by someone's ring, hit with hangers (I guess it could've been worse) etc.

I tried to kill myself for the first time when I was 8 years old. We would have a bunch of sleeping pills (homeopathic nonsense) and I would take a bunch of those. I think it continued until I was 11 or 12, when I got strong enough to fight back. When I was 10 years old, I started having daydreams, fantasies about someone, typically female, abusing me. The logical end was that it was that they would feel bad and it would stop, but I like to linger at the part where I get hurt. I turn it over and over in my mind, I modify it a bit. It gives me a high, I feel cold in my chest and I cry but it feels good somewhere. I get turned on, too. Maybe it was because sometimes the abuser would sit on me or immobolize me, I am scared of thinking that there might be a sexual abuse component to it somewhere, but who knows. I feel like I've blocked out or lost some memories.

I just wanted it to stop. If I fucked up in my studies, or whatever, I would get hit and screamed at. I guess that made me obsessed with success and not being a failure. I truly failed for the first time when I was 16 years old, when I failed to medal at an international competition. Although I ultimately got what I wanted, I had no energy, was extremely irritable and unhappy, and just all around sad. Apparently this was MDD + the c-PTSD? 

A few months ago, I got put on an antidepressant that made me feel so much happier/with more energy. I was more openminded etc. I had never felt that good in my life. I came home for break and I haven't really seen anyone besides my family, and I guess I've had the time to go back to those daydreams, and I re-live them. I feel like my mode is very volatile, a few days ago, I had 20 ibuprofen in my hand and was ready to take them. Just an hour ago, I started feeling sad again, and I was thinking of killing myself.

I feel like this affects my sexuality, too. I feel like my attraction to men is out of masochism, I think about how unhappy I will be, and when I think of being with them, I feel the same cold feeling in my chest. I have only had crushes on girls, my sexuality with them seems positive rather than negative. 

I think I am addicted to the cold feeling, it feels good somehow to be in pain or imagine being in pain. I want to break this cycle, I don't want to moodswing like this or want to kill myself and not be able to focus, but I don't know how. I thought that the drug would do it, but it's not enough. I'm 21 and I've never been in a relationship and I have a hard time trusting people and I'm scared of the future. I just want to be ok. :( "
2,"Trouble with anxiety and dissociation I feel like lately I’m either in a dead panic or completely fuzzy and detached from reality. I just want to feel clear and happy again but the constant battle to find a middle ground between panic and dissociation is fucking killing me. I’m currently in EMDR and remembered some memories of my trauma that I hadn’t before, not sure if they were repressed or if going over it all in my head again brought them up but I’m pretty sure that’s what’s triggering this. 

I don’t know what I’m even looking for by posting this, I guess I’m just venting. If anyone’s has similar experiences or if you have any advice I’d love to hear it "
2,"I took a shower! Bathrooms are generally very hard for me to be in/around, which leads to me skipping out on a lot of hygiene related stuff. I hadn’t showered in a while, but tonight I did, and I feel incredibly proud, and I just wanted to tell someone that..."
2,"I'm about to start EMDR therapy! I've been struggling for so long, and after you guys urging me, I sought out an EMDR-trained therapist, and she's great. She agreed that my case is too severe for just talk therapy and thinks I'm a good candidate for this specific kind of therapy.

Yay!! Thank you guys so much. I'm feeling very hopeful tight now."
2,"Two stretches you can do at home that actually help make rage and anxiety go away These things seem dumb and I swear to God I didn't think they'd work, but a therapist I had told me about them and they actually do work.

To stop a feeling of rage: Stand straight with your feet apart. Raise your arms as high as you can above your head, and put your hands together (like people do when they're praying). Stretch as high as you can. Jump and land on the floor, bringing your hands down between your legs, and hold that position for a few seconds. Basically it should look like you're holding an axe chopping a piece of wood. Repeat this a few times until you feel your rage subside.

To lessen anxiety: Roll up in a ball. Put your head down by/between your knees (if you can), and wrap your arms around your legs. Squeeze yourself as hard as you can, try to tense all the muscles in your body that you can. Hold for as long as you can (like 5/10 seconds), then release. Repeat over and over until you feel some relief.

I also posted this on a popular PTSD forum website (which I haven't used for years and HATE). I hope this helps someone out there."
2,"Not sure if I still need meds? At the height of my ptsd I was on a bunch of stuff.  As things got better with therapy I slowly started weaning off the meds I was sure I didn't need for sleep or whatever until I got down to just Prozac.  

I tried to come off my Prozac last year and had a ton of rebound symptoms that persisted after several months so I went back on it.  Now I'm off again and don't have anything that's in my face saying I need to get back on it but I'm just not sure.  The main changes I've noticed in the past month have been: 

1. I wake up several more times a night/have more trouble falling asleep but it's not so bad as to interfere with my life during the day right now.

2. I'm emotionally much more numbed out, not really ever happy or sad or angry.  I just feel nothing a lot more of the time.

3. Difficulty focusing/staying motivated.  

I also MIGHT have slightly more intrusive thoughts/flashbacks than I was but I'm not sure. 


Does anyone have similar experience withdrawing from antidepressants? Is it worth getting back on meds at this point or am I probably still in withdrawls?  


I've been struggling with this crap for years so I will continue with therapy either way.  I just would like to be medication free someday if that's at all possible."
2,"Wonderful experience with Prozac I've been in therapy on and off for about 4 years now, following a traumatic incident. I got a new therapist in early 2016 who eventually diagnosed me with PTSD and recommended twice weekly sessions.

I found myself feeling worse than I ever had before (my main trigger, unfortunately, is extremely commonplace and something most people enjoy). 

HOWEVER- my GP prescribed me prozac for a totally unrelated health issue (PMDD- essentially being an emotional wreck for a week before each menstrual cycle).

After being on the prozac for a few months it has made such an incredible difference in my life, my coping, and my ability to navigate the world when I'm ""triggered"".  I don't feel dulled, don't have any side effects other than reduced appetite, and generally feel so much more capable and in control. My panic response has greatly reduced (though not completely disappeared, naturally) and I find myself less reactive and miserable when I'm forced to face issues and situations that previously caused me a great deal of anguish and anxiety.

I've heard plenty of negative stories, so clearly this medication isn't for everyone, but I thought I'd post about my positive experience just in case anyone is weighing their options.


**edited to add that I'm still doing the therapy :)"
2,"PTSD without actual trauma? I need some help here. I’ve been to several psychiatrists who have told me I have all the signs of ptsd. A major one is nightmares. I get them every night, and have for as long as I can remember. I can’t remember ever NOT having nightmares. But it always stumps the doctors because I can’t recall any major trauma happening to me. Does anyone else share this experience? They can’t diagnose me because I don’t have any real major traumatic events that have happened, but I have all the symptoms as if I did. "
2,"Need advice on finishing internship while dealing with PTSD and anxiety Though Im still hesitant in saying I have PSTD it pretty much looks like it. Yesterday I went to see my psychologist and she agreed it would be best to treat traumas I got from my previous relationship with EMDR, which we are starting next week.

Im not here to talk about my past but I need some practical advice. Im a student in the last month of my (paid)internship and I have been feeling guilty about calling in sick a lot. My supervisors are very understanding and kind, thats why I was able to keep up the work most parts of the months. 

But now Im really struggling with the last straws. I have a paper due and it is stressing me out. Usually I called in sick once every two weeks or worked from home once a week because getting out of my house in the morning gave me anxiety. I need some practical advice on what to do with this last month. Maybe I should call in sick for real, like until I feel better and finished this paper, maybe I should work half of the week or only half days, maybe I should just suck it up. Maybe I just need someone to tell me you know its okay to call in sick, you dont have to feel guilty your working on yourself and thats whats most important. I self lack this view because I mostly dont consider myself helpworhty, which is another problem on its own. 

I already contacted my mentor from school yesterday. The last time we spoke she told me I could figure it out with the internship company if I knew what would work for me. Problem is, I dont know what works for me. Each day is different. Last week I had 3 amazing days where I got a lot of work done. But the other 2 I could only throw up, cry and sleep. There is no telling in which way a day is going to go. So I feel like it would give me some rest if I gave myself time to work on this paper or going to the internship part time. That way everyone knows what to expect from me instead of just seeing if I will be able to show up everyday. 

On the other hand, over the holidays when I had some time off I felt awful. I really dont like being on my own all day and had a lot anxiety that I had to show up for work the next week. So being at home all the time didnt work out that well. 
I never called in sick for a longer than a day in the past because the pressure to show up and fear of losing my job or getting kicked out of school. But thats what is getting back to me now cause I dont have a healthy view on how to get better.




As you see Im constantly questioning myself, I just dont know what would be appropriate for someone in my situation. How do you guys handle this stuff? What do you do to get productive and how do you handle the stress of a deadline when there is so much going on in your head? Have you taken a longer time of work to deal with your mental health and how did that work out?

Thank you so much for reading this, I am very new to all this and its a bit of a thing for me to ask advice cause it means admitting I need help. Which would be okay for someone else, I just feel ashamed about the whole situation, its not a walk in the park you know..

TLDR: Gonna start PTSD (EMDR) therapy and dont know if or how I can finish my internship. Need some advice on how others deal with the aspect of jobs and expectations.

2,"Could this be considered traumatic? NSFW First of all - yes, this is a throwaway account, and yes, I'm getting professional help - but that starts in three months. I'm trying to prepare for getting help by collecting my thoughts and memories about what has happened to me, and this is one of the things. I'm not asking you to diagnose me - just maybe help me judge the severity of what happened? Just knowing that someone reads this would calm my whirring mind.

 I'm lying awake and I need to collect my thoughts. I'd really appreciate your help in judging whether this was abusive or not. I grew up with it, so I truly have no perspective.

My father needed things done his way. It applied to everything in the house - but especially how we talked. It should follow certain patterns so to better suit his (superior) way of thinking. If we disagreed on something, we had to ""discuss"" it. ""Discussion"" is a word that still makes me cringe - I'm 23 and haven't met him since I moved out at 19. Discussion went likr this; we sat down, and he held lengthy monologues, explaining ""how things are""- If we interrupted, stated a different opinion, seemed to ""misunderstand"", anything but agree and say what he wanted, he would start over. This could go on for hours. I always remember this happening; as a kid, I was very often late to come out to play, and missed other's birthday parties because he wanted to have a ""discussion"". I could see the other kids gather outside, wait for me and eventually leave because I didn't show up - the discussion wasn't finished.

This was my only reality. If I didn't do what he said, he would make increasing threats about removing ""privilegies"" (=anything I enjoyed). The purpose of this was to force me into submission. Nothing else. To end it, I had to recite long, detailed apologies and sound suitably humbled, and ""llike you mean it"". Of course there was no sincerity - he only wanted me to debase myself and beg for forgiveness. I often did. I'm deeply ashamed of it, but I was a kid, and I wanted to keep what friendships I had.

Sometimes I didn't give up. Or, sometimes my frustration rose and I started talking back. I want to remind you - I was a kid, and later a teenager. I was /not/ a problem child, and no one but he thought I was defiant in any way. But when I talked back, he continued repeating what he said, or told me to be quiet/sit down/have a discussion like an adult. This escalated, and we started shouting. I also started panicking, contributing to the shouting, because I knew what was about to happen. My pulse is quickening as I write this.

I was a kid, and he was trained in martial arts. When I shouted, he'd drag me down onto the floor, sort of get into a big spoon position behind me, pin my wrists with one hand and cover my mouth with the other. I was panicking, fight or flight mode, my mouth was covered (and I had been crying by this point, so either snot was blocking my nose, or his hand was). I couldn't breathe. I only wanted to get loose, get away, but I couldn't budge his grip. He wouldn't let go until I held still for a longer period of time. I was a kid. I was a kid who was panicking, who couldn't breathe, who felt deeply scared of a parent, and humiliated.

Limited oxygen is a good motivator to obey. Eventually, I gave up. I was a complete mess, everything hurt and I was terrified. He made me wash my face in cold water - and hen he made me apologise for causing such a scene.

My friend jokingly held her hand over my mouth the other day, and I panicked again. Similar things have happened many times. I was in bed with my ex, me as the little spoon, and he loosely grabbed my wrist - panic.

I realise as I start to cry while writing this that it wasn't nice, but I have no other reality to compare it to. I know it's not half as bad as what others were through, but I really would appreciate your thoughts on like - the severity? Or just some affirmation.

Thank you in advance &lt;3"
2,"I'm back in therapy and it was probably the best decision I could have made. Hello, all. I've been reflecting on the events of 2017, what with it being the new year and all, and I just wanted to share a little of my happiness with everyone. 

I was diagnosed with PTSD a few years back because of extended trauma going back from elementary school all the way through to college. When I was diagnosed, I had actually sought out therapy for depression but due to some conversations with friends and the things I was currently studying in my Stress and Trauma class (I was a psych major) I realized that I fit almost every symptom listed for the PTSD diagnosis as well. 

I had been receiving therapy through my university's health program which allowed for a certain number of free visits every semester. But then my therapist left the university clinic and went into private practice. I continued to see her, but I couldn't afford the insurance copay and eventually stopped my visits altogether. On paper the fees were reasonable, but all my financial info was based on the fact that I was technically still considered my mom's dependent. In reality, she only paid for my insurance and I was living in poverty while trying to go to school because I was receiving pretty much no help from my family and couldn't find work. 

From then until just a few months ago, I wasn't receiving any treatment for my mental health issues. Last year was rather hellish for me. I was in a much better situation financially, I lived in a better apartment, had a job, and in a lot of other ways my life was objectively better. But emotionally, I was suffering. It hadn't been that bad for me since I had escaped the awful home life that traumatized me in the first place.

It took a lot of mental energy in a time where I didn't have much, but at my lowest point I finally researched therapy offices in my area. I got married two years ago and my partner's insurance covers most of the cost. Plus, we're fortunate enough that I can afford it without having to worry about still being able to eat afterwards, unlike when I was in college. So I called and made an appointment. 

That was back in October. I'm now going through CPT (cognitive processing therapy). It's really fucking hard, but so far it has absolutely been worth it. I'm putting a lot more time and effort into improving myself. I've been much more productive. I'm doing things I used to love again. Things that used to seem a distant dream or completely unachievable now feel like they might be things I can tackle - if not now, then *someday*. I'm more hopeful than I've probably ever been. My partner has been unbelievably supportive and has said they're really proud of me for all the work I've been doing. 

I'm not quite there, yet. It's still a struggle. But I'm making it. I feel like I can do this. And I hope that all of you reading this can claim some happiness for yourselves, too. 

Much love ~

TL;DR: I have gone untreated for over three years and just got back into therapy a few months ago. Already it's made a big difference and I feel like I'm getting my life back. "
2,"Anxiety to rule the day and bad dreams to rule the night I went no contact with my abusive, narcissistic mother about 7 years ago...FINALLY. But the nightmares are still going. I have found some relief through Topomax and therapy, but I still wake my husband up yelling at least once a week. I wonder if I will EVER be free of these nightmares."
2,"Anyone else here have PTSD related to a physical injury that can never be repaired? Edit: sorry I realized I probably should have put a trigger warning in the title. 

#[TW: Physical injury of sexual organs, medical negligence, suicide]

Look in my post history for more details (on /r/suicidewatch), but the basic gist is that I had surgery a few months ago, and the surgeon managed to amputate my sexual organ. I'm being vague here with vocabulary because I'm intersex and my anatomy is unusual, but I'm a guy and still have a penis, but it is not the source of my sexual sensation. The organ that was amputated was.

I previously had issues with trauma, but it was all the kind that was easy to dismiss as not being severe enough for PTSD. This is on a whole new level, and I'm seriously struggling with functioning day to day. The only way I'm able to is to shut everything related to this event out of my mind. I feel like I'm swatting flies in a dump. I'm completely numb most of the time, because allowing any emotion in opens the floodgates to the horror and pain of what happened to me, and it's just absolutely unbearable.

I'm struggling to see how I can live with this, or how it can ever get any better. I've lost sexual function, and have this constant physically painful and uncomfortable reminder on my body of the trauma that was done to me.

How on earth do you cope when you cannot separate yourself from the source of trauma, and it will never go away?"
2,"Involuntary shouting, growling, whining, laughing and a strong urge to scream and punch things, and restlessness at bedtime. I've had a lot of traumatic experiences in my life and I started meditation a while back and ever since then this has been happening to me. It's like ""old junk"" is coming up from the past. And it's been happening for years, I'm wondering if it will ever end. Anyone experience this?"
2,"Does your ptsd get blamed for a lot of your medical issues? I find that any time I have a physical / medical issue it’s almost always first blamed on ptsd, anxiety, depression, or adhd. 

Does anyone else get this often? "
2,"Boyfriend triggered me today (accidentally) My boyfriend was driving us around today in an area that he is not familiar with but I am very familiar with, as I used to live in the area. Anyway, I was directing him as we went along and there was a bit of a communication mixup. I told him something like ""get into the left lane and turn, not here, but at the next turn,"" but before I finished the sentence he had already started turning. Then he swerved into the other lane to correct himself.

This caused me to apologize profusely and once we were in the right lane he was like"" gosh, get better at giving directions!"" which immediately triggered me. My ex used to constantly undermine me and especially my sense of direction. I started crying and hyperventilating. My boyfriend of course, was just joking (we ~fake~ get mad at each other all the time) and felt so bad.

I'm so mad that I can't just joke around with my boyfriend without being triggered. And it's the most random things. Giving directions, picking a movie to watch, etc. It makes me feel guilty (for making him feel bad) and it makes him feel guilty (for making ME feel bad) and then it seems like he walks on eggshells afterwards.

Im so sick of my triggers. So over them!!! "
2,"Please tell me that you can escape from this? Sometimes I feel like I can never escape my ptsd. I get triggered a lot it seems like. I thought maybe I had bipolar. Now I’m starting to think that this is how I react when I get triggered? I’m diagnosed ptsd/anxiety/major depression, and they said possibility of bipolar 2. 
When I freak out, I can get mad and impulsive, or cry and want to hide in the smallest, darkest spot possible. I hate people seeing me react though, so if I get triggered in public, I’ll just hold it in so no one can tell. Which actually feels way worse than just letting it out. 
Then I have night terrors all the time. 
My question is, does this ever end? I’m tired of feeling like I’m constantly running. It’s exhausting. "
2,"Flashbacks I don't really want to go into details of my flashbacks. I have several. I don't really know much about flashbacks.
I know they can be intense.

But some of mine seem like hallucinations. Does that happen to anyone else?

2,"Using Meditation to Help with PTSD Symptoms? I have been seeing a therapist for my PTSD for a while, as well as the frustration and stress from dealing with fibromyalgia. I am going to be leaving town for a few months, so I won't be able to consult with my therapist until I get back, but today before I walked out of the door from my appointment, he mentioned meditation. He stated that it has helped some other clients of his, but didn't go into enough detail to help me comprehend how I *could* or how *to* meditate. 

So, **to get to the point here,** do any of you guys meditate? What do you do? Does it help? I'm just about willing to try anything at this point, as Zoloft and marijuana are just barely keeping me afloat some days. "
2,"Has anyone survived a terrorist attack/assassination attempt? How are you getting on today? Just wondering if you're doing okay. 

I was stuck in the Bataclan for four hours during the Paris attacks of Nov 13th 2015. I'm better today but I still have PTSD. Noises reminding me of gunshots are the worst and I think I'll struggle with this all my life.
"
2,"Experience reporting sexual abuse? Is it worth it? (X-post from /r/rapecounseling) I was raped repeatedly by a family member over the course of about 4 years as a child. In my state there is no statute of limitations on reporting and after years and years of trauma counseling I finally feel the urge to report what happened and press charges. Do any of you have experience with this? What are the first steps? Is it even worth the trouble? Will I have to see him again? 

I’m a little torn because as much as I want justice for what happened to me I definitely don’t want to re-traumatize myself by reliving everything in front of strangers  just to have my rapist get off. I know that happens often, and I’m worried that after ten years it’s no longer realistic to have him convicted. 

Any advice or personal experiences would be really helpful"
2,"Home alone this weekend I could use some support. I live with my boyfriend, but he is going out of town this weekend. The last time I was home all alone overnight was around 6 months ago. I also had one of the worse panic attacks I've had in a while last night. It doesn't help that my grandmother is in a nursing home with dementia and rapidly declining. 

I'm just bracing for a week full of panic attacks. I'm at work today and am almost tearing up, I'm trying to hold it together because I've already taken a fair amount of sick time off (from being physically sick). My boss is fairly understanding, but she is out sick today. "
2,"My therapist doesn't believe in diagnoses, and I feel like it's keeping me from getting treatments and accommodations. Heads up - most likely triggering. 

Hi Reddit! Quick background: I'm a 29yo woman with significant trauma from my borderline mom, my brother, and multiple abusive and manipulative partners. In the past two months, I was hospitalized twice, spent three weeks in residential treatment, and lost my job. This is definitely a low point, but I've never been able to work a full time job in my life - I attempt suicide every time I try. I've never had a real relationship or connect to people in a real way. I've been on too many meds to count and in therapy on and off for 15 years. My hospital/residential therapists have all agreed on my diagnosis of severe depression, recurrent, psychotic; (C)PTSD, severe, and alcohol use disorder, moderate. Basically, I'm completely falling apart.

I've had two things suggested to me: trying to get a service dog or applying for disability benefits. I feel like either one would be extremely helpful to me, especially getting a dog - Animals are my only real passion and I feel such a strong connection to dogs. The problem is that my current primary therapist (seeing her for a year) doesn't believe in diagnoses. She believes I'm able to get past everything that has happened so I can function like a ""normal"" person. She was willing to write down diagnoses of MDD and PTSD for FMLA, but nothing beyond that. 

Am I just kidding myself, and thinking that my PTSD is worse than it really is? Or are there actually therapists out there who don't believe in psychiatric diagnoses? Am I fooling myself in thinking I could actually get a service dog who could get me out of bed, make me take my meds, and help be be in public/hold a job, and help me stop being afraid of everyone in my life? 

TL;DR:
Severe C-PTSD and depression such that I can't work full time or have real relationships, but my therapist disagrees because she doesn't believe in diagnoses. I want to try for a service dog, but she won't sign off on the paperwork that says I'm significantly disabled. Am I overreacting or do I need to find a new therapist?"
2,Applying for disability? I'm curious if anyone here has had success applying for disability for PTSD resulting from domestic violence. 
2,"A shadow just set me off. It's 1 AM. I'm sitting here minding my own business and I see something that looks like a very large person walking past my living room window towards my front door in the dark. Two lamps are on in the living room, the front porch light is off, front porch window blind is 100% open. Side porch light is on. Streetlight is on. It takes me a full 15 minutes after getting my gun and checking all of the windows and door locks to calm down enough to even consider it's something other than a person. I'm still not confident it wasn't. Though my driveway alarm didn't go off, that's not impossible. Unlikely, but not impossible. To people that don't have PTSD it's difficult to explain the sheer panic your body goes into at a moment like this, and the time it takes to calm down and snap back into reality. I broke down in tears. I should be able to sit in my living room without freaking the f out because of a shadow. I guess I'll be shutting my blinds from now on. Good Grief. "
2,"Nightmares I have recurring, very “real” feeling, deeply emotional dreams/nightmares. 2 to 5 nights per week, same type of dream. How in the world do I make them stop?... so difficult. Typically involving a particular person, but someone I haven’t seen in 2+ years, seen regularly in approximately 4 years. "

2,"second hand depression i have a gf that has ptsd about her past. She had to saw her mom had sex with other guy in front of her eyes when she was 9 years old. Then, she also threatened by her mom at age 11 years old. her mom want to stab her and her dad. With this life experience, she had a ptsd in her life for a very long time. she grows up with her father and her little sister. now, she's 22 years old. 

i got my second hand depression while i have a relationship with her. when she tells me about her past, i got a really deep sympathy and empathy feeling about her. but, i can't do much to relieve her pain and i can't make her happy while she was in the ptsd state. so, i just listen to her and can't do much. i have a horror vacui about make others happy (the state when you fear of emptiness; ex: horror vacui for being poor means fear of not having money), so when i cant make other person happy, i feel depressed and sad. Im afraid that i can't make other people happy. i'm actually feeling sad and depressed right now because i can't make my gf relieve her pain. so what should i do? and also what should i do to relieve the pain? some of my friends told me to just listen to her. i can't, then i feel sad when i cant do nothing to relieve her pain."
2,question about ptsd My ex gf always claimed that she has ptsd from a traumatic event when she was a child. Basicaly she saw her father slap her mother in the face. She says that that caused her ptsd. I dont want to be mean or anything but she is basicaly acting like a bitch and doesnt want to help others because she has ptsd. Uses it as an excuse for everything.
2,I lost the first job I’ve had since my breakdown  I had a breakdown and I finally get a job nothing too serious. Something to help me get back on my feet. I got fired. No one told me why. Just... “we are rehiring someone.” I can’t help but think what did I do? What did I say to someone so they didn’t like me? Did I do things the wrong way?  Now I have therapy and medication and no job. 
2,"Non-combat PTSD I was diagnosed with PTSD from years of childhood sex abuse. I know what I went through was traumatic, but sometimes I can't help but to feel like I don't ""deserve"" the diagnosis because I have never been in the military or a police officer or anything like that. 

I feel like because I've never been in an actual combat situation, and because the abuse happened when I was a kid, I should have been able to get over it without developing PTSD. 

Just wanted to vent a little and was curious if anyone has had similar feelings."
2,"Possible trauma from hospitalization, and people think I need to get over it. I was 21 at the time, now I'm 22. In May of 2017, I got really sick out of no where. In a matter of 3 days, I went from feeling slightly out of it, to intense thunderclap headaches, pale, body aches, delirium, and ultimately passing out. I didn't want to make a scene or go to the hospital because I was just starting a new full time job, but I had a feeling that I was going to die. I can't really explain that very well, but I just knew deep down that someone was very wrong. 

At 4AM I took an uber to the hospital and when I got there, upon checking my vitals (very low blood pressure and 160 resting heart rate) the nurses helped me onto a wheelchair and wheeled me into a bed in the intensive care unit. At this point, my memory is very groggy but I remember multiple people helping me take my clothes off to change me into a gown, and then doing an ECG on me. They got an IV into me and gave me a valium injection, as well as nausea medicine. I thought that was odd because I didn't feel nauseous at the time. 

The doctor came in and asked me what was wrong. I just cried and said my head hurt so bad, and he said ""what, you think you have a brain aneurysm?"" I said I didn't know what was wrong. 

After they took my blood, a few hours they sent me home because the brain CT came out relatively normal. I still felt extremely sick with a feeling of overall dread. I'm going to die. It wasn't anxiety, it was just something I subconsciously knew. 

They discharge me at 3AM and got me an ambulance to take me home. They ruled it as a ""nasty fever"" and told me to rest for a few days.

At 6AM, I woke up to multiple voicemails from the ER doctor telling me that my blood culture came back positive and that I immediately need to go back to the emergency room, or any hospital near by that I can get to. That was the closest one so I took an uber back. An ambulance would cost too much money and I was having issues with my health insurance at the time. 

Positive blood cultures mean that there's bacteria in your blood. I was diagnosed with bacteremia and severe sepsis. I stayed at the hospital for 2 weeks while I received antibiotics and more image screening.

Being septic eventually gave me a condition called pancytopenia, which is a lack in all blood cells (red, white, and platelets) and the antibiotics I was on (clindamycin) wiped out all the good bugs I had in my stomach so I caught C.diff, which dehydrated me and I had to stay in the hospital longer. 

I returned to work less than 2 weeks later, 15lbs lost and generally very weak. They understood that I was very sick and didn't push me too hard my fist few weeks back (I have a very physical job). 

Now I'm healthier, but I still have a constant fear of getting sick again. I try to explain this to my mom and friends, but they think I'm just being dramatic and a hypochondriac. I don't feel safe anywhere but the hospital. I'm constantly scared. I don't have a fear of death, but knowing that I could easily become diseased and suffer, and leave all that I love behind makes me sad. It makes me sad that people don't understand what I went through. They are not educated on sepsis and think well ""hey, she didn't have cancer"" (my coworker actually said that, and later attributed my sepsis to being a vegetarian). I really don't talk about it a lot, but when I do, I get eye rolls. It's like people think I enjoyed taking a month off work. 

I constantly suffer from panic attacks now, where I feel dizzy and can't breathe well, but there's not much I can do about that. Ativan doesn't help. My body and mind have been through hell and no one understands, or gives a shit. 

Thank you for reading, I just had to get this off my chest. "

My girlfriend was sexually assaulted and has told me what happened in detail. However, I am unable to remember what happened to her from the story she has told me. I feel my mind is trying to block it out bc I don't want that visual in my head of specific details. Is this normal? I usually have a very good memory. Thanks. "
2,"Molested by father... Complacent mother... I'm 22/f, when I was around 7 years old during a custody battle between my father and mother, he was granted visiting rights to me and he constantly assaulted me for two years. By the time he lost visitation rights, I hadn't told anyone, and he went to prison overseas for something unrelated to me... He is back in the country now and I am constantly afraid of him... What's the point in pursuing it if I see in my country child murderers have gotten less than 10 years...?

By the time my mother found out, we never officially reported to the police, she grew up telling me to forget it, I was self harming, she couldn't understand why, I was extremely isolated, anxious and alone. I felt bullied by my mother at times, she is an emotional rollercoaster, even I can see that now... I have so much anger towards her now and she calls me every few days... She belittles my trauma, promotes mentally unhealthy ideas to me, makes me feel like she isn't my mother.

I am TIRED OF HER telling me that she did the best she could. BULLSHIT. By marrying a man you only knew for 3 months and letting this happen. I have worked so fucking hard over the past few years to get my mental health in check and she is holding me back, I haven't seen her since Christmas when she threw a temper tantrum because she didn't like her present.

She LOVES my brother. He has easily stolen 150k+ from her since teenagehood. He is 28, narcissistic cheater, and my mother let's his girlfriend who has been involved also in seuxal trauma (no secrets in my family) to be blindsided by my brother. I'm over it. I'm dirt fucking poor but I have a lovely fiance... I'm just venting... I'm  so sorry."
2,"Being a young mom with PTSD When I first had my daughter I was unaware I had PTSD. I had shoved my childhood abuse in a closet to never look at it again.

But after months of sleep deprivation, fixating on having to be the perfect mom and excessive paranoid thoughts of my beautiful child dying or being kidnapped I was coming undone at the seems.

My husband pushes me to go to therapy and I learned that my erratic moods, my paranoia, my insomnia... just every little thing that made my life hard was real. It wasn't just me defective, born wrong. I knew I could do something to improve my life and my daughters.

However anger is a huge problem for me and one time when my daughter was about 1.5 years old, she was being a kid. An I just lost it, I screamed at her at the top of my lungs and slammed the kitchen cupboard so hard it broke off its hinges. The second I turned around and saw my daughters scared face I broke down.

I asked myself how I could do this? What kind of mother scares her child? I held her close and I promised myself I would die before I ever let my anger scare my child again. But its not so easy, the anger comes faster than I even have time to process whats happening and it bursts out of me. When I was young I used breaking this as a way to vent it, but I can't any longer go around destroying crap, especially not in front of a 2 year old.

My solution now? Lay down on the floor. Literally as fast as I can, lay down flat on the floor, face down and take a few deep breaths. Tell myself ""you're mental illness isnt who you are"" over and over again. When my daughter stops throwing a fit, or doing whatever it is that has dried up my patience levels and sees me, I pop up and go ""peek a boo"". She then laughs and goes ""again!""

The point is... My biggest fear is my mental health causing my child to be scarred, to have a broken childhood. It feels so good to take a moment I am not emotionally in control and turn it into something she sees as so innocent. She's too young to know that mom isn't perfect. Right now she wants mommy to be her perfect hero, and God dammit I'm gonna be that for her. 

I'm still in therapy and I've taken so many huge steps towards living a better life, I haven't even started my EMDR yet but I'm hopeful. I dont know who else out there has kids, or wants them. I know I'm not the perfect parent by any means but I'm trying, for me and for her."
2,"Some thoughts on dissociation? Not sure if this sub is the right place. Let me state beforehand (because that's the usual reaction) I'm not asking for pity or love or empathy or help or advice or ""go see a therapist"" or anything, I just wanna talk about the topic with people who may have something interesting to say about it. If you feel the impulse to do any of the above, please refrain, it's not helping or contributing anything to me for reasons I don't feel like having to explain over and over.

Okay, so, I've been through some hideous shit as a kid and I think my personality is kinda split in a few parts. I've been doing meditating/introspecting/feeling into it and becoming more aware of the details over time.

Either way, I am not sure how precisely I can put this into words and this may not make sense to most people, but I'll do my best to describe it accurately at least for those who've had similar experiences.

In particular, there is one aspect that I'd like to hear some interesting thoughts on.

There is this part of me that has kinda separated itself from the traumatized parts. This part seems very ... psychopathic, you could say. It's very detached and cool and rational, seeing all these things without feeling like they affect it personally.

Now, I sometimes try to connect that part with the other parts, but when I ""jump into"" that part, I basically realize that this part finds the idea unacceptable/offensive that the pain/the other parts could have anything to do with it. 

If that part could speak for itself, it would likely say: ""I am caught in this disgusting body, but this body is not me. I don't understand why this body has anything to do with me, I wouldn't have anything to do with something disgusting like that, it doesn't concern me. I am just sitting here and waiting to flee this body, it is not right that I have to be attached to this impure body that carries such a disgusting pain. I refuse to communicate with this body or the pain, because it is none of my responsibility to deal with it, for I am a separate person from that body and that other person (the body) should not expect me to take care of it, because it should be able to deal with it itself. It offends me that the body wants to drag me into this crap that has nothing to do with me. There's nothing for me to gain from such a partnership (me and the body), fuck off and take care of your own shit.""

Mind you, this part is NOT in pain (most of the time). Rather, it refuses to be. It kinda conceives of itself as a kind of heroic resistance to the pain. This part of me is actually feeling kinda comfortable most of the time I would say. I would even say I feel a bit of pride in this part because it has such a clear view on everything and feels rather pure/unspoiled. The downside is that this part is very mental/celebral and does not really have any control over the body, so whatever great insights it allows, it cannot act on them, as the body wants to focus on the pain instead, which is frustrating. It feels confused and angry often, because the rest of the body doesn't listen to it and is controlled by fears/needs that shouldn't really be a thing from its own viewpoint.

This celebral part in fact is so convinced that the pain has nothing to do with it that it treats it as not much more than, say, an annoying cousin that sometimes visits. It does not see it as a problem that needs to be dealt with. Just something that occasionally hinders it in being who it wants to be, which results in frustration and anger. Something that, if need be, has to be eradicated (which of course doesn't work). I suppose you could say it is arrogant, in its refusal to have anything to do with the other ""weak needy"" parts that are so easily controlled by outside circumstances and emotions. It considers such an existence as ... low and pathetic. Yet cannot escape it. 

Outside of anger when the other parts try to take over, it doesn't really feel much of any emotion at all. It's ... empty ... but in a satisfying detached way. It's not even necessarily evil I think, it can even be caring towards other people at times (but not really towards myself). It tends to be fascinated by intellectual problems and solving them.

Now, what I've been trying to do for a long time is to try to force this part to connect with the other parts. But it doesn't really work. It simply refuses to do that and/or ""tricks"" the other parts into believing it had accepted them, only to reemerge later with no change whatsoever.

My thinking is, I likely need to find a way to convince this part that it is in its interest to merge with the rest. Maybe that involves convincing myself that that is actually the right thing to do. Maybe I need to try out ""jumping into"" that part and letting it ask itself that question and figure it out.

Anyway, I've come pretty far to even be able to see it as clearly as I do now and I'm sure I will eventually find my own answers, but I have to say I am a little intrigued by it and I was wondering if someone else who has dealt with some horrible shit has had similar experiences/observations and has anything interesting to add or just wants to maybe exchange ideas/observations, because its rather hard to find people who can follow this and thus good stimulating exchanges about it are rather rare.

2,"Finally getting help I had some childhood trauma.  And being young I thought it made me strong so I thought the best thing to do was subject myself to almost 2 decades of running emergency calls on an ambulance.   I saw plenty of traumatic events that didn't occur to me directly but some damage was done nonetheless.   

I injured my back and of course doctor prescribed Percocet turned into street corner heroin in no time.  All of it doing nothing but making me not care about the pain (physical and emotional).  I also had self medicated throughout my EMS career when I was off duty after particularly stressful weeks at work I would occasionally use marijuana to help fight the demons and let me sleep.  

Well the herion use started increasing  as no it is wont to do. And then my 10 year old son stop breathing last April.  And the herion use skyrocketted.  I've been haunted by many things but nothing... And I mean nothing has haunted me like having to preform rescue breathing to my son.  

Luckily he is still here and much better.  About 6 months that after he stopped breathing I decided I need to quit herion before I stopped breathing. 

I looked for out patient Suboxone programs the soonest I could be seen was 8 days away.  I knew I wouldn't make it without using so I signed into a 6 day detox 2 days later. (There was some problems getting accepted at detox but I got in) 

 When I got out my suboxone appt was the next day.  I went to see the doctor.  He was very brash and his demeanor was not encouraging.  He told me he treated every patient the same with the same dose.   He told he would probably fail me out if I was positive for thc or opiates.  He was setting me up for failure and very unsupportive.  

I went home had a friend recommend a different doctor and the changes were to the extreme.  The new doctor helped adjust my Suboxone done to make sure I was comfortable.  A psychologist not just a therapist provided my therapy.  They made a customized care plan. Not just a ""cookie cutter"" plan.

They explained constant failed urinalysis for opiates would get me kicked out (as it should) but if I had a lapse and was honest they would help work on what caused the lapse and help me avoid another. 

After going for a few weeks I was nervous because I still occasionally smoked marijuana. Mainly for nightmares and anxiety.  I decided I had to tell my doctor's.   So I did.  And they shocked me by stating they were ok with it and felt I was using it to treat my PTSD AND they said they'd give me the paperwork to get my medical card (my state is medicinal legal only).  

They truly have a great model to really help their patients.  Their long term goal is to get every patient off of all medications or on as few as possible.  

They also prefer to treat PTSD with marijuana than any benzos or anti depressants.    

With their help I have been clean 3.5 months.

It is truly amazing to see in a state that still has some puritanical views.  I am so happy to see the progress. 

So today I had the money together and contacted a doctor.  It turns out he's as compassionate, passionate, and caring as the Suboxone doctors are.

For the first time in a long time I feel like I am making progress with my demons.   For the first time in as long as I can remember I can envision a future.... And it gets brighter every day!!!

2,"Iv had ptsd for 10 Years, I was never told what to expect or what a flash back is. A little insight in to my more manic/panicky moments would be good Iv had PTSD since I was eight, following a car crash on the way to school.  The car crashed on mine and my mums side of the car.  My mum fractured her spine and the first few days/week in the hospital she couldn’t stand with out pain.
For the first few weeks of being back at school we walked the 2 miles in the frozen over rurel farmers fields to get there and back. I grow more and more disinclined to attend school.   I would do anything to hide, somtimes when we stared driving to school again I’d locking my self in the car when my dad and my sister got out and refuse to unlock the doors until I was promised to go home.  I felt numb and anxious I’d cry my self to sleep every night and feel anxious about school the next morning and then when I didn’t go in I’d feel guilty for not going in. But if I did I would wonder the buildings and playgrounds with a fake smile on my face because I didn’t want anymore people coming up to me to ask if I was okey and if I was sure.  I would reassure them with lies and somethings walk home without telling anyone.
Because I stayed at home rather than go to school I watch my mum grow more and more inclined to stay in bed as she became increasingly dependent on tramadol. Her addiction lasted 3 or so years.  When she recovered from her addiction she put her healthy weight back on, her bra size went from an a/b cup back up to a d/dd. I know because she gave me her old bra and said it was from that time

Iv seen over 5 therapist (art, edmr, talky, and one I can’t remember the name off) and at least that again with more specialist therapists in one of sessions.  Iv developers a kinda phobia tonwards them. I don’t really talk in therapy session and the reply’s I give are the ones that mean the least interaction and communication.  My reaction to therapy was stronger that my reaction to school

There’s an emotion I feel when I’m in a state sometimes, it’s indescribable and like nothing else I experienced.  If I had to compare it, it would be to vonrability, fear, shock and a few other thing.  I get panicy and anxious and it’s like there’s a filter over my preseption of the world in those moments and I all my 5 sense except some time touch apear  the same but feel more overwhelming and like there’s a pressure coming in from all sides (in non physical sense).  And usally I cant find an explanation for what I’m experiencing and I’m left to find the darkest corna way from everything and begin the waiting game to bring myself back down feeling numb or I go quite manic and wonder with a head strong panic and confusion and this emotion that I can’t describe, searching for a cause to my alter state. This often leads braking thing or being mean to my little sister over tiny thing or screaching to be left alone then just feeling all the worst for it.

^^Is this an emotional flash back?^^

No one ever told me what ptsd really entails, if you cold give me a little insight, it would be appreciated.  x

2,"PTSD court treatment update #2: The Euphoria is wearing off and reality is setting in. It’s not all bad, but it’s not all good. It’s a punch in the gut.  4 days after my last post a marine I was in the same squad with killed himself.  That makes the average about 2 a year from my company (150 guys I was closest with in the marine corps.  4th from my platoon of 30) since 2010.  

I hid it from the court, because it’s not their business.  I went to where I needed to. Just listened to music in groups.  Went through the motions with the random doctors for medical visits.

After a 10 days I reverted, hard.  How dare I not have visited him?  Why did I lose contact?  I could have let him know he wasn’t alone. I could have saved him, like I want someone to save me.

In my head it was clear.  Its like every other person who got killed when I was point. I thought I making the right decisions but I was wrong.  I made the decisions that killed or hurt many of my best friends as a point-man.  What route we took, how we set up, how long to wait before picking up, how far we could walk before dehydration.  I fucking killed someone again.

10 days ago, (14 days after his suicide) I was at deep in the pit. Dark room, sleep, hate myself for being awake, people looking down into it telling me to “just climb out”.  That fucking pit...

Told the therapist a little of this, she handled it well.  Let me kind of hide it, but later suggested writing groups and sent texts of articles or books I’d like to read through the next few days. One day she even broke VA protocol and did a Skype session.  Very appropriate and sensitive response. 

Thankfully, I just kept doing the court ordered things to stay out of jail.  It forced me to get up, to get dressed, to function, abide poorly .  Go to therapy.  Take my meds.  Nod a lot.  But not isolating completely.

Honestly, I didn’t want to deal with these people around me who didn’t know...combat? I guess?  I was up however, so I started texting my old war buddies, cuz I didn’t want them to feel like me.  It’s one of the biggest things I’ve noticed about PTSD.  The guilt.  The sickness when you’re alone, reworking things, how you could have stopped EVERYTHING.  It crushes me.

To avoid jail, I just had to keep getting up though.  I had to keep going through the motions.  It’s the first time, in a long time, I kept going through the motions.  I kept working without knowing it.

What used to be a 6 month to a year spiral was caped at 5 days.  The past week I’ve been catching myself shaving, because I wanted to.  Cooking myself a meal, because I wanted to.  Laundry, because I wanted to.  I haven’t done that since 06’. 

Am I irritable? Am I stressed? It sleep rough? Am I fucking sad? Yes.  That’s still there right now.  But I’m up.  

I’m doing choirs.  I’m making my meetings.  Im not isolating nearly as much.  I am  slowly feeling I can make it through this moment, rather than this moment being everything.  The pit is less shallow than it’s been since I can remember.

I’ve read over what I’ve written for about 20 min.    

I guess the difference from before I started the VA court program and now is this:

I still disassociate, I still break, I still feel crushed, I’ll never be “Ok”

BUT

The pit is less deep and it’s easier to climb out.

2,"I hate February I hate that month because it is the month when I first got assaulted. Every time that month comes I experience the most stress, paranoia, flashbacks, nightmares, insomnia, panic attacks, etc. (I mean, I experience these symptoms every month but February when these symptoms become the most prevalent and intense). I'm so scared. I don't know what to do. I don't have a support system in real life. "
2,"Triggered There is a place. Where ""why"" is a question. And ""why"" is not a question. 

And certainly it wants an answer - but the answers can't be given. It's screamed out in a whisper with hands clinched, teeth shown and the jaw locked tight. 

Anger runs with blood through the veins. But all this self medicating can't dissolve it. Neither will self inflicting pain quiet it. Virtue is removed, stripped. 

This is the calm within the storm.

2,Any book and online resources for tweens to work through traumatic experiences? Are there any book and online resources for tweens to work through traumatic experiences?  I am looking for resources to assist tweens in dealing with traumatic experiences.  One person in particular continues to re-live bad memories.  I am not very versed in this subject but want to see if there's something out there that might be useful while this age group is in therapy.
2,"Struggling to cope I've had PTSD for around 10 years now. First, it was all from how traumatic everything was when I saw my dad die and then when some things happened with my ex boyfriend. I'm now married and my husband doesn't believe that PTSD is a real thing. My mother in law just thinks I'm being dramatic about all of it. Last night, I had some bad nightmares and this morning, my husband woke me up by grabbing my arm and getting in my face (new anxiety meds put me in a deep sleep). I told him to get off of me and to stop touching me multiple times and he still kept doing it. It triggered everything and just made me freak out. I ran to the bathroom to be alone but he followed me and banged on the bathroom door calling my name which made everything even more worse. When I managed to get out to take some anxiety meds, he still got in my face and would not leave me alone and eventually ended up throwing my phone at me hard and calling his mom to tell her everything. As usual, he response was that I'm being dramatic and overreacting. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm tired of the nightmares and my husband and his family not understanding what I'm going through.im tired of constantly being told I'm being dramatic.  I see a psychiatrist for meds and am waiting to see a counselor for therapy. I just feel like giving up and dying sometimes because of all of this. I've calmly talked to my husband about how I feel, but he doesn't seem to care about any of this. I'm just done. "
2,"2003 It happened in the fall of 2003. I was getting off the bus and a boy that lived in my neighborhood was walking to his house. I ran up and tackled him, as we have done many other days before. We would always wrestle, have snowball fights, goof off. Today was different. 

When he got up he grab my arms and I grabbed his back ready to wrestle. Thats when I felt something hit my in the ear hard and my leg buckled. I was then throw to the sidewalk and he laid on top of me and kept hitting me with his right fist into my left cheek. I remember trying to get up and saying ""Let me get up"" but kept getting punched in the side of my face. Then the back of my head was slammed into the concrete. I was then let up. I didn't know what to do. It was me, him and one ""friend"" just watching. He looked again, smiled, and came towards me. Again, I was thrown to the ground, hit in the side of the face multiple times, and had the back of my head slammed into the concrete. 

I walked home to find a knife, any weapon, but couldn't find anything but a brick in my front yard. I walked back to scare him to try and get him to back down. I didn't ever want to hurt anyone. I dropped the brick and again I was thrown to the ground, punched repeatedly and had my head slammed. It must have been 3,4,5 times. 

I walked home with that ""friend"" and immediately cried and broke down. This day has replayed in my head freqently ever since it happened. I turned to drugs at 14. Isolated myself. Didn't take care of myself. Then i started getting bullied. I was so scared I let it happen and never said anything. Plotted suicide. 

Its been 15 years and it has been replaying in my head ever since. I have difficultly making friends. I stay home most weekends. I feel i will never amount to anything. On the outside I look successful. I work at a great company, I go to night class to further my career, I was a successful amateur boxer, I have a great family and girlfriend. But I cannot shake this event. Sometimes I wonder if life is worth living. 

I started going to therapy consistently in 2016. I have done talk therapy, cbt, EMDR, energy healing,... I am lost. I hope I can get through this but there are times I feel I will never be confident. I still binge drink and still go through depressive spells. I wonder how my life would be if this didn't happen. It has been 15 years. 

If you have taken the time to read this I really appreciate it. I know time is very valuable and this is a rambled wall of text.  "
2,"It’s been some rough stuff Lately I’ve been feeling like my quality of life has gotten so much better since I’ve gotten a better therapist and since I’ve gotten my medication figured out, but I’m still having sleeping issues. 

I was prescribed trazadone of 1 to 3 tablets a night and it’s insane how heavy the carry over is into the next day. And I’ve had other sleeping medications and it’s the same thing. I just feel so exhausted all the time because I know my quality of sleep is not good. 

My partner, bless him, I swear, tells me he hears me talking and grinding my teeth hard in my sleep. I also sweat to the point of soaking my sheets and every morning I wake up and my hair is so wet you’d think I just stepped out of the shower. It makes me so self conscious to say, but I’m having the most trouble communicating with my doctor my struggles. 

I used to have terrifying vivid nightmares but I haven’t really had them/ remembered any of them since I started smoking marijuana a few years ago. My partner says he thinks I’m having them sometimes. I don’t really know what to do. 

I’m not in a legal green state otherwise I’d have my medical card and I’m sure more of my doctors support, but I’m not so sure. She knows I smoke and doesn’t hate it but doesn’t approve. My therapist doesn’t give a shit. 

Tonight I was even having such a hard time I just bursted out crying after having an outburst at a banker because of having no money due to the holiday and me getting off late every Friday to be unable to deposit my check until after hours and my bank said something was possible and tldr when I get there it’s the opposite so I’m full of frustration and lately I’ve been feeling as if I’ve been disassociating and just disappearing into space with the fact that I’ve had a lot of time off of work lately because my boss has been on vacation I just kind of summed it up to having too much time on my hands.

 And while that’s partially true, I have had too much time to sit around with just me and my thoughts. I also recognize that I have a harder time around the holidays and winter in general. 

So tonight I canceled my late therapy appointment and just came home and drank wine in a onzie and cried until I smoked enough to feel good enough not to cry. 

I’ve been having a hard time talking to my therapist because I don’t ever know what to say. She presses a little and I just say it sucks and it is what it is and I can’t change it and then like it’s book closed. 

I don’t know how to communicate or open up I don’t know what I’m supposed to do to get over this because I need to feel like a fully functioning human being to work and be alive. But I can’t do that if I’m always sleepy and just shut out. 

I don’t feel as shut out with my partner but I’m happier around him and the air feels more clear. He knows my trauma and my shit and we don’t elaborate further, not that it’s a problem it’s horrible. 

I just need to know what I’m doing wrong because I’m trying so hard and this cycle sucks. Advice on sleep, sweats, and talking to your therapist would be dope. Also don’t be gross everyone sweats so like don’t go into detail even though I appreciate the advice lol"
2,"DAE: Dissociate when triggered to the point where you’re unresponsive? Lately, after I hit a trigger, before I have a full blown panic attack, I’ll completely dissociate. It’s like I just check out for a period of time until someone grounds me and gets me out of it. I get completely still, which is rare for me, then check out entirely. Typically, the only thing to bring me back is an ice cube in my hand. Upon return, panic commences and I’m slightly disoriented. Does anyone else experience this type of dissociating? And if so, what helps you? "
2,"Trying to help my friend, but I’m in a corner Without going into too much detail, my friend is recovering from an abusive relationship. They’ve been making some decisions that I know they aren’t happy with and regret. I’m in a spot where I don’t want to say the wrong thing and upset her/make her think I’m controlling her, but at the same time I don’t want to enable destructive behavior. 

The sidebar has already been really helpful, but I’m wondering if anyone has some advice for this kind of situation. "
2,"PTSD is costing me job after job! This is the 3rd time PTSD has cost me a job! I don't know what to do! I feel so worthless and the biggest disappointment! I'll get to the point where I feel I can drive again (driving being one of my major triggers) and my panic attacks will be manageable, but every time I get a job all my triggers return. The really bad panic attacks where everything goes numb, the nightmares and insomnia, the suicidal thoughts, my brain telling me everything is dangerous, everything! I can't win! I've gone to counselling, but I had to quit half way through due to insurance issues. I'm lost, and tired of not being normal! Any advise?"
2,"What to do when it feels like too much? I opened the can of worms recently (a few years ago), and started dealing with my trauma. I was diagnosed with PTSD at 16.  Ummm, there's a lot of stuff here, and it feels like too much. I just need to tell someone all of it, because I've never told any single person more than just bits and pieces of it. 

*My dad did drugs
*He hit me a lot, came after me and my mom with a knife once
*He lied and said he was dying of cancer to get money from me once
*I've been estranged from him for a number of years, but his friend lives near me and sometimes tries to follow me home (I'm almost more afraid of the friend than my dad)
*My mom is not much better; she gets violent sometimes, though seldom with me. Mostly, she just throws things, slams things, screams, tells me I'm a mistake and a waste of space, etc.
*I was sexually assaulted by my pediatrician when I was a child, and I really struggle to go to the doctor at all now (I once had to be escorted out of a hospital for biting a nurse, so there's a thing)
*My babysitter from age 3-5 used to beat us, lock us in closets, and step on us when we ""misbehaved"" (sometimes, she'd get mad at us because our poo wasn't the right shape?). Her children also stole things, and when I'd try to get them back, I'd get hit/ locked in closets/ stepped on.
*My father spent a bunch of time in prison for domestic violence, but I still had to see him because my mom wasn't willing to go back to court. So, I saw him beat his girlfriend almost to death and break her hand with a door. I thought I was going to die a few times. 
*I once broke my foot and my dad was asleep/ high/ whatever, and he didn't believe in doctors. So, he wouldn't take me to the doctor, and I still can't use that foot properly. I have needed walking aids in the past (canes, crutches, a wheelchair once) but I've been in physical therapy lately and the muscle is building up a little bit again. 
*I was abused by a scout leader when I was in my teens, and the scouts went OUT OF THEIR WAY to keep it quiet, instead of helping me or doing anything about the leader in the program. So, I had to leave, and the leader did not. 
*My mother's anger is getting worse and more frequent. She will go off over nothing, and I don't know how to keep her from getting angry. I have no choice but to keep living with her, as I am unable to keep a job and minimum wage isn't enough to live on anyway.
*I lost one of my good friends a couple years ago when she was hit by a train.
*Lost my closest family member (my baby cousin) in 2017 when she fell in a river and drowned. 
*I was in a ""relationship"" for about a year with an adult man when I was 15, and I didn't realize how messed up it was (though I always got the feeling there was a significant imbalance of power... Idk, I thought it was normal).
*I may have heart disease (Idk, still testing), and that scares me because I could drop dead of a heart-attack any minute. 

All of this weighs on me a lot. Like, so much, it's hard to function. I don't know how people who go through wars or famine can even keep going. I am just so alert, all the time. I am so scared, all the time. I have daily panic attacks. I am nearly always on the verge of suicidal thoughts. I'm in counseling, on medication, and going to two groups a week. But it's not enough. Things feel like too much.

I want parents, honestly. Just someone to comfort me, for once in my life, instead of encouraging me to kill myself (my mom has done this). I want this to end. I want to forget all of it. I want to start fresh and have a new life, with a family and people who actually love me and don't try to hurt me. I'm 23, but I feel about 5 years old. I want a chance to be 5 again. But I don't want to die.

I don't know what to do.

2,"My Partner has Disassociative Flashbacks and Runs Off - Need Tips Hello,

I'm new here but I have been looking for some help with this for a while and I thought I would try to see if someone from this community might be able to help. 

We are in the process of getting her to see a psychiatrist and start therapy, but until the medical insurance clears we can't do that. Until then, she has a habit of running off when she flashes back. When she does that she's sometimes in her PJs or without her phone. When that happens she ends up waking up lost and cold. She has also occasionally self-harmed while in a flashback. 

Due to all of these concerns, I would very much like to equip her with a GPS so that when she runs off I can find her quickly and bring her home ASAP. Does anyone have any tips on what kind to get? Or, perhaps some other tips about either other ways to deal with this or anything else. I am always open to suggestions. I just want what's best for her and for her to get through these rough episodes as quickly and as easily as possible.

Thank You."
2,"I feel like it's my fault It's making me want to die. I was the one who got drunk, I willingly went into the room with him. Sure I said no and passed out only to awake to him throwing my body around and penetrating me, but I got myself in the situation to begin with. I've never wanted to be dead this much. I feel so disgusting and worthless. I'm in so much pain over the entire thing it makes me sick. I feel like I deserve to die."
2,"PTSD triggered by people in general Is there such a thing as PTSD triggered by people in general? Like you've been treated like crap by people in general throughout life, that now you can barely be around them without having symptoms of anxiety, nausea, flash backs etc. "
2,"It is offensive to use the term ""PTSD"" lightly/casually, like people do with ""OCD""? You know how there's a big controversy over misuse of ""OCD""? Like ""Oh my god I'm so OCD, I always have to keep my room clean.""

What about casual use of PTSD? Like ""I have PTSD from all the beeps in kitchen in my fast food job."""
2,"Has anyone else thrown up from anxiety/panic? It’s not uncommon for me, though, most of the time I don’t vomit 


Has anyone else experienced this? "
2,"dont know what to do anymore . . . hey everyone

I have recently discovered i am very hyper vigilante and have bad anxiety/PTSD. I talk to my councillor atleast once a week at school but now my problems have snowballed into bigger badder things. I am starting to have disorientating visuals and panic attacks for no reason. Sometimes im super low and other times im super happy!.

I flinch so easily for no reason in public which is embarrassing and my visuals disturb me. 

MY question to you all is were do i go from here?

should i maybe talk to my doctor about medication or talk to a professional?

I do practices to prevent certain behaviour but right now im stuck and dont know my way foward."
2,"Ashamed of my triggers So it's been 11 months since experiencing my trauma. I've come a long way and I'm really proud of myself for all the progress I've made. Unfortunately, though, a very big trigger of mine has recently become more prevalent online, and because it's online, my friends often talk about it or joke about it in real life.

The problem is that I can't tell them that this thing triggers me. It's...embarrassing. Not the idea of having triggers and standing up for myself, but the trigger itself is embarrassing and I'm afraid that people are going to think I'm joking. I'm afraid they are going to ask questions that I can't answer, or make me explain why they can't make these jokes around me.

I feel like knowing the trigger would be beneficial to you guys reading this but I'm just so...ashamed that this is an actual trigger that causes me actual distress when the thing is just so stupid. I am sorry this post might come off as complaining, but I just need to know if someone feels the same way."
2,Help with letting go of trauma when it is actually your fault. I need advice (or even better some book recommendations) on how to let go of trauma that resulted from your own mistakes. About a year ago I fucked up pretty good and I haven’t really had a day of rest since the resulting shit-storm that ensued.
2,"Music to listen to during a ptsd episode to calm down? I do not like generic calm music, it actually gives me anxiety. I prefer music with meaningful and well thought out lyrics so I have something to focus on. What works for you?"
2,"I want to go a single day where I'm stable. I want one day where I don't fear that I'm going to die, or have a panic attack, or think someone would abandon me. I want one night where I wake up in cold sweat from a nightmare. I can barely remember what it's like to feel normal anymore.

Every day is a battle just getting out of bed. Every sleepless nights makes the day unbearable. I just want this to be over. I don't want to kill myself, I want this to get better. My life can't just be distractions and trying to get through each moment. People say things can get better but I really don't see it.

"
2,"When two people with ptsd date Despite therapy I'm not great at bringing up when I'm uncomfortable, so me and Partner have a deal that I bring up whatever asap, unless someone needs to go to the ER. Guess what happened?

Anniversary of a trauma was coming up, and before my partner could reply to 'is this a good time to talk about this?' I had to whisk them to the ER. They're fine, but I'm still shaking because the injury was similar to one of my other traumas. Partner is totally unaware of this trauma. 

Anniversary rolls around and we spend some super chill time together--Partner still manages to do the most triggering thing ever. Because I'm me I went on autopilot, seemed fine, until I got home and lost it on my partner via text.   



"
2,My friend said anniversary date of trauma could retrigger me (any advice on how to cope?) I kinda wish my friend didn't mention it but I mentioned myself that the traumatic event from last February would be here soon and she said that some of my PTSD symptoms associated with that date could come back. I'm really nervous for February to come because my trauma made me have the worst panic attacks possible. I'm really scared now and hope my brain doesn't attack me on these future dates...
2,"Lashing Out and Long Term Plans I know that I'm a bit mentally fucked right now and I have been lashing out at my endlessly supportive partner. He's been an absolute rock and had to deal with me getting black out drunk and angry because I was ambushed by my abusive father over the holidays. 

I've been massively spiralling and I didn't tell him in words that anyone except me can understand. (I'm working on that bit already). I've been crying almost at a drop of a hat. I've been ignoring him. I've been distant. I've been clingy. It's doing my head in, I can't imagine how he must feel. I've said stuff to him in order to push him away and make us break up, so that I am free to punish myself / hurt myself in whatever way my messy and broken brain sees fit to tell me. 

I'm in the process of getting back into therapy, even if it's only a short burst of 6 weeks or something. I need to be able to structure what happened between me and my father in a concise way and then build out to what the current major issues in my life are. 

If you want to offer advice, the two things I really need to know is (1) how do I stop myself lashing out when the entire world feels unsafe, and (2) what's the best way to discuss C-PTSD causing events with a new therapist? "
2,Does your PTSD cause paranoia and delusions?? Hi all. I’m new. I got into a car accident about 10 years ago that triggered my ptsd. Over the years it’s gotten worse to the point where I cannot even be a passenger on the highway without visions of car accidents where I’m dying. My body also constantly clenches up as if it’s ready for impact the whole time I’m in the vehicle. My boyfriend thinks it’s some type of paranoia/delusions/psychosis when it comes to the visions of the car accidents that I’m having. It’s not flashbacks. Just like videos playing in my head of what could happen. Is this normal? I’ve seen many therapists and they haven’t said anything negative about it. 
2,"Unsure if what I'm doing is destructive or good Hi. So, I've got c-ptsd and bpd, and I've been having a good holiday even though I'm having a low/bad period. 

Saturday was like something just snapped in me and I needed to be alone (or as alone as I can be in a house filled with people) and I just distanced myself 100% from most places where I have contact with my friends. This happens from time to time but this time I'm too tired to really analyze what's going on, so I thought I'd reach out and ask if anyone else gets this need for isolation? 

A couple of friends has messaged me and like said they're here for me if I need it, and even so I feel alone, and like I deserve to be alone, and I feel so aggressive, not like aggresive as in violent, more like, when I read my facebook feed, I think nasty comments as I scroll past, and I feel like picking fights, so instead I've gamed a lot to avoid doing something stupid and ruining friendships.

I guess what I'm asking is, does anyone else relate to this? Does it seem like a destructive thing to do or constructive? 

Thanks for reading, and I hope you will have a good new year."
2,I feel in danger I constantly feel like I’m in danger. I have a hard time falling asleep in random places or other people’s houses. I’ve been spending the night at my girlfriend’s house a lot lately. It’s hard but I think I’m getting to that point where I feel safe enough to sleep. But I’m still really alert and hypervigilant. Anyone have any tips on dealing with this?
2,"PTSD make me a POS I just want to go die in a corner. Go to sleep and never wake.

Fuck a 'new year'. no such thing. Just one big blur of shit."
2,"Untreated early childhood Ptsd This is long and I'm extremely disorganized, my apologies. 
Guess I'm just looking for hope that someone recovered from something like this. I can't find much hope in researching this, or find anyone else who talks about this. Not as a ""oh poor me I have it the worst""- I dont, but it's quite severe objectively.  Here's how I'll explain. I was diagnosed with PTSD about 4 years ago. However, my symptoms began very fast after the traumatic event 20 years ago. I am 23. I had all the PTSD symptoms Ive had since being diagnosed ever since it happened 20 years ago- the flashbacks, the nightmares, disgust and intrusive thoughts, hypervigilence and just constantly on the lookout, and just all around sheer terror when faced with a reminder of the event. (I would really really really appreciate if you don't mention anything medical related if you comment). I literally let this go my whole life, no one ever knew this event happened until i was faced with a situation where I had to inform my now-husband. Which didn't involve me saying anything but ""something bad happened a long time ago"" and from there it was just a yes/no guessing game for him. From there he got me into therapy for it. By this time I was beginning to have psychotic symptoms. Which brings me to my next point. I can't talk about the event. Physically my brain and my mouth won't say the words. I can hardly think about it and manage to keep it together. Now being in EMDR after jumping around from asshole therapists to ones that literally said they can't help me, i haven't been able to even start the EMDR therapy and it's been about 2 years of just building trust. But I can't manage to bring the event up in my head and not lose my shit. There's even been a second traumatic event that had similarities with the first event later in life, as well I've had issues with substance abuse (I'm clean), and nasty depression crashes. I feel like because the event happened at such a major part in brain development, and then because I let it go into adulthood, I think I'm fucked. 
TL;DR  I think I'm fucked but has anyone gotten past this "
2,"Now I’m triggered by flying. :( I’m about to get on a plane for the first time since being sexually assaulted on one, and my body is freaking out. I’m shaking and feel like panic-crying. I don’t want to get on the plane. *I don’t want to get on the fucking plane.* I had no idea how much the assault affected me until today, since I’ve been through so much worse. I could use a word of encouragement from someone because no one but my therapist knows this happened. I just want to be home."
2,Why am I triggered by fireworks? SO weird I am triggered by fireworks when my traumas are sexual and physical abuse. Makes no sense to me at all...
2,"i’ve been doing so well and now it’s all ruined i’ve had ptsd for about a decade, i really thought i had it handled, but i got raped for the second time and now everything feels terrible and out of my control again. i don’t know how to get back to a place where i feel in control. i keep seeing flashes of the assault and i want it gone i can’t see this anymore, i don’t know what to do. it was my coworker and i don’t even know if i have the strength to report this, i’m scared ill somehow end up being fired "
2,Episodes Just joined an honestly need to know that there are people out there going what I am in order to just relate. I was raped by my ex step father when I was 8 and later diagnosed with ptsd from its been years and the episodes still happen. Just the heart racing flashes of images and tears begin to well and I just break down. Some are better than others but they happen way more often sometimes 4 or 5 a day. I’m a high schooler and dealing with it and my depression cutting etc it’s just too much. I think I’ll break once he’s released. He was a cop so they cut his sentence by a few years. I’m so scared of my own brain 
2,"Torn About College Hi everyone! I've been attending a four-year university four hours away from my hometown, so i've been staying in the dorms up there and trying to soak up that ""traditional college experience."" Truth is, I really hate it. I was diagnosed with PTSD at the end of 2018, alongside depression and anxiety. My trauma happened in February of 2018, so it is pretty fresh and still hurts. It's terrible timing that I also had to go off to college for the first time a couple of months after. My hyper vigilance intensifies when I am at my college. I don't feel safe at all, but I've been toughing it out for 2 semesters to see if I still like it and get acclimated. I like the school and it's objectively a good school to attend, but don't know if it's the best option for me right now. It has a few cool things that I like (great academics for my major, amazing recreation center and yoga) but it all boils down to my PTSD. 

My other option is a school 20 minutes away from my home, and commuting there because  I feel safer staying at my house. I'm kind of upset about leaving the ""Traditional college experience"" behind but then again it's for my mental health, and i really didn't like it anyways. I'm not into partying, drinking, sports, or greek life, so it was hard for to meet people since my school is big on those things. I'm anxious i won't make friends as easily at the commuter school, but i also don't have many friends currently at the university that I am attending. I've had my first long break since the summer before senior year and it's the best I've felt in a while, since I've been away from the university and am now getting anxious about returning next week. It might be a long shot that anyone has experience with this. Regardless, can anyone give me some help/advice/reassurance? I'm not sure what to do. (I've also never posted a text post to reddit before let alone this sub so excuse me if I'm doing everything wrong haha)"
2,Trauma has destroyed sex for me I guess I should be happy that I’m numb to this
2,"I just got yelled at by the police and I’m shaking!! I am a 27 year old black (half black and half white) female.
I was driving down the highway when I see a police car flash his lights at me. I have never been pulled over on the freeway before so I thought it would not be safe for me to stop on the freeway. So I took the first exit coming up and slowed down, I open my window and yell if i should stop here. He yells pull over. He comes to my right passenger window and demands, “why didn’t you stop your car? I’ve been flashing my lights awhile!.” I say, “Oh I didn’t know if it was safe for me to stop my car on the freeway that’s why I took the next exit. This wasn’t the area I was supposed to go to.” In an intimidating and attacking tone he asks, “do you need to go back to drivers ed? You should always stop your car when you’re being followed with flashing lights! When you drive away, that’s what people do when they are running away because of drugs! I started following you because you were swerving in the beginning. Why were you swerving? Were you on your phone or something? Do you need to go back  to drivers ed? Let me see your license and insurance card! Are you from (says my address on my license)?”
I told him I was not on my phone and there is a lot on my mind which may explain why I was swerving a bit. It felt like he was totally treating me like a criminal, not giving me the benefit of the doubt, and was also trying to get me in trouble (trying to get to me to say something about me being on the phone). Also when he asked if I was from the address on my license it was in such an accusatory tone. The address listed on my license is a white suburban area. I wonder if he thought I was not From there because I am black?!

Then he goes to his car and another police car pulls up. I think he called for backup?! I see that police officer get out of his car and talk to the police officer. Then he goes back to his car and leaves. Then the police car comes back smiling (probably because he realizes I have a clean criminal background) and was like “ok, next time you know to pull over when a police car follows you and keep your hands on the dashboard (which I did). You can go free without a ticket just a warning.” I just slightly smiled. If I said anything I would have burst out crying.

I have been crying for like an hour and called the crisis line, too. Is this a typical experience with an officer?  It seemed like he liked scaring and belittling me?!This was so rude. And I also wonder if I was being racially profiled like he was being ruder because I am black?

I was so affected by this because I’ve had two similar experiences by police officers where I felt they were attacking me. Men in power who are angry and attacking is very triggering. I also was scared and sad because it reminded me of police brutality incidents I read about on the news.

2,"My Story TW: sexual abuse, strained family relations

I started to type a bunch of background, but this is long enough. I may post a more in-depth story at some point, but here are the basics: when I was about 13 (memory is hazy) my older (by 3 years) half-brother molested me for several months. I kept it hidden for over 10 years, only telling 2 or 3 people, until I started going to therapy about 2 years ago. I then disclosed to my mother because my therapist said she had to report it to the authorities (of course nothing came of that, small town and all). She told me she too had been abused by her step-father, as well as my cousin who I was close to. She told my father. Tears were shed, they seemed supportive. I remember my father talking to me and him telling me he and my mother were on the same page and that my half-brother was out of the family. They'd only talk to him if he was essentially dying in a ditch. I had not told my half-brother that my parents knew, I was waiting for the police to question him. I don't think that ever happened. So I still had to spend the holidays with him. That spring I sent him a letter telling him everyone knows and I never want to speak to him ever again, he is dead to me. He texted me and told me not to let any of this affect my relationship with my nephew (his son), which made me furious. I told his ex wife (nephews mother) and his then girlfriend (now wife) and they  were shocked but understanding (of being distant, etc). Things seemed to have gone well. Over the next 2 years (up until now) things would slowly fall apart, mostly thanks to my mother, but maybe it's because I least expected it from her. He was still invited to family functions, as long as I wasn't going to be there. The first giant mess came with the family trip to Florida that had been planned. I assumed he would be uninvited, but my mother kept saying ""I don't know"" when I asked if we were still going. Eventually I called her after work one day and it went something like this, 

Mother: ""Well maybe there'll be time for him to go and for you to go."" 

Me: ""Are you fucking kidding me? It's like NOTHING has changed since all of this came out."" 

Mother: ""Everything has changed""

Me: ""He's still going on the fucking family vacation! What the fuck has changed?""

Then she started to say something and I hung up because I was at a crosswalk and people were probably staring.  So I eventually told her I was just not going to go (for reference we live in KY and the trip was only for 7 or 8 days, I was not going to drive or fly down there for 4 days, especially not because of him) and she said, ""Okay, it's up to you."" I still went on a different trip, the week after, with my mother, grandmother, and some ladies they work with (my grandma owns a tax office where my mom works and the ladies that work with them always take a yearly trip to FL). 

After that the holidays seemed to be fine. Thanksgiving was normal (as in he was not in attendance at either my mothers side or fathers side dinners). Then Christmas seemed normal, until I got to the meal for my mothers side (parents still together, we just do their sides separately). We did a lunch time meal and the more I looked around I noticed all of the presents the kids had opened. Basically they had Christmas the day before, with him, and I was just there for leftovers (not actual food leftovers, but it felt like a secondary event). Now, I understand that I do not have children, and he does so they wanted all the kids to be able to open their gifts together, but that doesn't mean that he had to be invited. So I talked to my roommate and my therapist about it and we assumed all of this had to be because he had threatened not to let my family see my nephew unless he was allowed to come to family events with him. It still hurt because it meant they were choosing my nephew over me, but it was slightly understandable. 

The next mess was Easter. We haven't even been a big Easter family for a while, but it falls near my young cousins birthdays, so I usually try and see them. Well, my boyfriends family was having Easter on a certain day (we'll say Saturday) so I said I would be absent. Then later my boyfriends family moved their day to a different weekend. Then my cousin (the one who was also abused and I used to be close to, and the mother of my cousins) sent me a facebook message telling me that my other cousin and her 2 kids would be coming in for Easter as well. They live about 5-6 hours away so I don't see them often, so I asked my cousin to speak with him and tell him there has been a change of plans and he cannot come. She basically said no and told me to talk to my mother. So I called my mother while leaving work and told her that I wanted to come to the Easter dinner and she said she was not changing the plans. Things got heated and I was screaming at my mother in the hallway outside my office. Later I sent my mother and cousin messages about how they were not being supportive. It may have been a little snippy, but I was very hurt. My cousin did not respond kindly and basically told me that she had dealt with her issues and I needed to deal with mine. My mother told me she would respond to me and she never did. My mother came to therapy with me a couple times and always cried and said she didn't know how to deal with any of it and she still has unconditional love for him but doesn't like what he did. Then eventually I called her out again and explained everything that had happened. Basically just sent her a cliff notes version of all of this and asked her what I'm supposed to think of things at this point, she said shed, respond, never did. So after all of this I told them that I would not be going ""home"" for any holidays anymore (I now live about 90 mins from my hometown) and they'd have to come see me. My cousin came to visit me I think once since then. I didn't see my nephew for about a year (part of that is me not reaching out). So Thanksgiving comes around and I send them a list of restaurants where I'd like to eat. My cousin basically says no to all of them, asks if we can eat at Cracker Barrel, I say that it'll probably be crowded, as we were planning on eating on Black Friday and the Cracker Barrel is by a shopping center. Then she suggested a restaurant near the college campus that I hadn't listed. I agreed to that one, then she changed it to one of the ones I originally sent that I ended up not really wanting after she suggested the other one. It was a mess but we ended up eating at the one near campus. My mother called me prior to the meal (a couple days) and I was cold and distant and she asked if I was going to have that attitude at dinner and I just didn't respond. The dinner was fine. So that was all on Saturday after Thanksgiving (they changed the day from Friday to Saturday so everyone could be there). The Monday before Thanksgiving my mother came to visit me and do some shopping. She got in town around 2 and left by 6 (it's a 2 hour drive, it honestly wasn't worth it). The short time was just an extra sting because I had told her about 2 months prior that I felt like she had just abandoned me, along with the rest of my family. I was always distant and never close with anyone, but now they knew why so I expected them to reach out, and I definitely expected my mother not to just ignore me. But I told her that I wanted to try and spend more time together to repair our rocky relationship and she never initiated anything. 

So my dads side Thanksgiving was on Thanksgiving day and my grandmother texted me a few days prior telling me that she is sorry but she didn't think I was coming (I never responded either way) so she invited him. I told her we'd just figure something out for Christmas (I wanted to yell and tell her that was shitty not to double check and shitty that she wants to be around him at all, but I just wanted to get everything over with). Then I told my mother I would not be there. So basically they tried to work it out for me and my fiance (went from boyfriend to fiance in October) to come early in the day and then he would come later. I told them that I would leave at 2 and they needed to tell him to be there at 3. I wanted no overlap. So we got there at 11 and it went by in a flash and then people hugged me goodbye as if it was normal for me to be rushed out so the piece of shit who molested me could come have dinner with them. So then we drove about 4 hours to his family Thanksgiving and said everything was ""good"" when people asked how it was. They asked if we were still hungry after already eating and I didn't want to tell them we left before the food was even done, that food wasn't for us. The shitty part is that's not even the shittiest part of all of this. That comes next. 

So I hosted a silent auction fundraiser in November and won a free party room rental through a local winery. It would have been big enough for all of my mothers side for Christmas, we'd just bring food, potluck style. So I asked them what day worked, then booked the room. I asked my mother for help with the (refundable) $100 deposit, and then she proceeds to ask if I'd want to come ""home"" to do this (this is the second time she asked). I said no, then she said that they can't come up to me to do this because it will be too much money and my grandmother can't make the trip. It would be one thing if this was last minute, but I had told them well over 6 months ago that I would not be coming home for any holidays with them. At the time I said that since my dads side had been seemingly drama free that I would still go there for those. And all they had to do was bring a dish. We could have ordered pizza for all I care. They'd have to make food if we did it at ""home"" anyway. Then as far as my grandmother, I know she's not the healthiest, but I honestly think that was just a way for them to get out of doing all of this. So we just didn't have Christmas. They chose not to have Christmas with me. I know that I'm partly being spiteful, but I'm just over it all. I'm tired of lowering my standards. 

&amp;#x200B;

So there's my story. I would like to point out that I am currently in therapy and know that I should not expect anything from people or assume things or be spiteful, but I am where I am. I expected too much from my mother and family and now I'm left feeling angry and jaded all the time. I'd also like to point out that my mother and cousin have always been close but this all has brought them even closer and they've formed some sort of alliance and my mother always takes her side. ALSO all of this is heightened because I'm now planning a wedding and am trying to figure out how to balance wanting financial help from them but not doing the traditional things like my father walking me down the aisle or father/daughter dance. 

&amp;#x200B;

I realize that I'm opening myself up to criticism here with how I've handled things, but I'm trying to share my story more, and this is it.

2,"Lost my best friend christmas day Kinda trying to figure out how to be “okay” again after living through the accident, what helped you with the nightmares/flashbacks if you were in something that the other person didn’t survive but you did."
2,"I’m so lost Just a rant. I just needed to get this out. I’m not looking for advice just a bit of relief. 


I’m so exhausted and scared. I’m not sure that I even want to fix this, I don’t see why I should. It doesn’t make a difference what I do, accomplish or battle against.. I always end up in the same place, same situation and with absolutely nothing to show for it. I don’t want the only reason for staying alive to be that I don’t want to hurt the people I love, I don’t want to live just for the sake of other people. Specially when I don’t want to live at all. All I hear in my head is “I can’t do this anymore”, everything has become overwhelming and I can’t handle it anymore, I can’t even control my own physical reactions anymore. I shake uncontrollably and go into full panic mode at the smallest things. I’m already seeing two therapists, I was put on anti depressants, put into a course about emotional control and I still can’t deal with my self, my uncontrollable fright, my self contempt and the feeling that I am utterly worthless. I’m not even sure why I’m posting this other than trying to get a little relief by writing this down and putting it out there (advice I got from my group course). "
2,"I thought I was handling it. But yesterday I got a panic attack I don't want to talk to people, but I do want to say what happened. So I decided to post here.

Short history: my mom and step dad mentally and physically abused me. My mom has done this for as long as I can remember. I don't have any memories of her being kind to me or taking care of me. She told me she would help me kill myself and that she didn't want to spend money on therapy for me. (Eventually she had to because I was seeking help/council at school and she didn't want them informing more authorities.)

My mom and step dad used to yell and scream and throw stuff at each other at night, drunk and angry because ""one of them drank quicker"" or ""had a glass more"" or did something else. 
Most of those nights they would decide that it was all either my fault or my dad's (they kept us separate after the divorce). So they would storm into my room and scream and yell at me how I was a failure and nobody loved me and I was dumb. Everybody was better of without me. 

I would often oversleep in the morning and be very late (an hour or more) for school, tired and afraid of the consequences. The dogs would've peed in the living room because they were incontinent and couldn't hold their pee all night. But it was my fault for oversleeping an hour ish. 

I was so scared every morning. I was too scared to go to school because I couldn't explain why I was late and I was scared mom would see me and know I was late and yell at me and grab me and punish me (I don't want to describe what it was. It wasn't sexual, but it was physical and emotional and I hate it and thinking about it) 

I was scared to wake her to ask and call because she would yell and scream when you woke her (if she woke up at all). Even if she told you to wake her up. 

And I thought with therapy and time it would get better. I avoid situations where i know I get triggered as much as possible. I chose a career where I would always be in control of how much someone could drink. And I always turn on as much alarm clocks as I can so I won't oversleep if I have to work in the morning. I still have terrible nightmares, but it hasn't happened during the day for a while now.

But yesterday I forgot to turn on multiple alarms. I came home so late and had to get up so early. I had talked to someone who was so happy to have turned in his essay that he started crying and it reminded me of how scared I was to fail and how I cried when I passed my exams. I went to bed and had a nightmare again where she told me I couldn't do anything and I failed at everything. I was all alone. Nobody would help me.

 I woke up, I was late and the combination of the nightmare and the feeling of knowing that I would be an hour late triggered me. 
I tried to wake up my bf, he wouldn't wake up and I got scared to do so because it didn't feel like him. It wasn't him. It felt like my mom. The light was the same light as it was there and it just turned into her home. I got a complete panic attack and started hyperventilating and crying and I just couldn't stop. I could smell the pee and the rotten food and I was so scared for the sound of stairs (I live in a house without creaking stairs because the sound will wake me up and set me in panic mode). My bf woke up and tried to help me but he didn't know what to do other then trying to let me focus on him. 

I don't know how long it took. Work called, bf explained I was hyperventilating. I finally started breathing normally and the headache started. I have cluster headaches that hurt like hell. This wasn't one, but it was in the same pain scale. I couldn't call work. I wasn't on my phone all day because I felt terrible. 

Now I have to go to work. I don't know how to explain what happened and how to explain that I couldn't call them earlier in the day or let my bf call because a panic attack doesn't allow you to be like ""oh, I'm scared to death. Let's call off appointments first before I can't do anything anymore"". 

I am scared of the confrontation at work and I want to run away. But I can't. I have to go. 
I thought I could control it. It has been a while since I had this during the day and I don't know how to deal with it. Every time I let myself think freely I hear her voice telling me that I ruin everything and I fail at everything.


TL;DR: i had a panic attack triggered be being late and having a nightmare. I thought I wouldn't have those during the day anymore and it took me by surprise. Now I'm afraid they won't understand at work. "

2,"Im all scarred I’m a 23 year old trans girl. I’ve been transitioning for three years. My childhood was absolutely terrible. The simplest way I could put it was that my parents hated each other and took it out on me. From when I was four during the day I was forced to go under the back porch like the “little ugly troll I was”.  I was sexually abused in ways I can’t bring myself to describe. I was hit and thrown and psychologically just tortured. And when I said I was a girl it only got worse. They had four more kids but they taught them to gang up on me and to enjoy watching me be hurt. Every night I’d cry myself to sleep and pray for a new family, I’d pray to be taken away and if I couldn’t have that I’d pray to die. I begged for help from the school counselor but since my family are millionaires and don’t “fit the type” the school said it was all in my head and had me put in hospital. My parents came across as so friendly and the perfect family with me being the only outcast. I have high functioning autism. So I have a hard time with change, and I think because of the abuse I haven’t been able to grow up. I feel stuck as like an eight year old girl or so, and I can’t talk to a therapist about it because it’s hard to explain. Like I can’t be a functioning adult. I mean I have a job and stuff and all that but I can’t act like a normal adult. I have a hard time with keeping friendships.

2,"I just want to forget. If I could give away any number of things to just forget what happened I would in a heartbeat. I guess it’s just one of those nights where I can’t stop thinking about it so I’ll get no sleep. 

I just want to forget everything. I just want it to leave my brain but I know it never will. It’s consistently ingrained in my brain and I can’t get it out no matter how hard I try. I’m constantly filled with the feeling of regret and guilt all backtracked with the lingering thought I’m going to be alone for the rest of my life. It’s hurts and I just want it all to end. "
2,"Ex got promoted after choking me. My ex-boyfriend and I dated for over a year and a half. I finally got the courage to leave him (after 1.5 years of emotional and verbal abuse) after he choked me and said he would kill me and my family if I left him. He also said he would get me fired, as he was a higher ranking employee at his job. I was able to fight my way out and I haven’t talked to him since. 

He works for the police department in my city. I filled charges on him at the advice of my boss and friends. His department did an “investigation” and told me that they cannot prove anything, as he denied everything I said. They said they dropped the case. 

 I just found out that not only was he not charged or punished in any way, but he was actually PROMOTED during the investigation. How he’s even higher ranking in the police department. 

I’ve been dealing with PTSD since I left him 2 years ago. Now I feel sick to my stomach because he’s going to kill someone eventually and because the department essentially rewarded him for abusing me. I also found out that a lot of my friends “liked” and commented on his status, congratulating him; even after they KNEW I was abused by him. 

He’s living a happy and great life while I struggle everyday with PTSD. How can I get past this? I don’t know what to do anymore. He will never be held accountable. "
2,"Which doctors when?? Looking for advice about professional treatment. I'm feeling a little frustrated/lost/overwhelmed by how sort of fragmented treatment seems to be. We have therapists, for emotional/talk stuff, we have psychiatrists, for meds and brain chemistry stuff, and we have regular old doctors, for body stuff. But that stuff is all so related, it seems impossible for it to be treated as three distinct areas by three different people who don't talk to each other. 

I'm not really sure what I'm asking lol. (new to this subreddit... hi!) I'm just anxious about this. I see a therapist weekly and a psychiatrist every month or two, but I have a lot of physical problems that I think are related to my ptsd (chronic pain, chronic fatigue, stomach problems, etc) and neither of them seem equipped to help with that. Seeing a regular doctor next week, and not sure if I can expect them to help with it either if its a psychiatric issue?? Not to mention I was recently diagnosed with ADHD, which I know can be related to trauma, so I don't know if I need my ADHD and PTSD to be treated as related things and not as separate issues.... I don't know. I'm stressed about figuring out who to go to when and how to get treatment that addresses all this stuff as a whole because I feel like addressing each issue as if its distinct and independent doesn't make sense or won't work or something. 

Does anyone have any words of wisdom about this? (It's possible I'm just being paranoid that treatment will fail if its fragmented in this way. That might be perfectly fine. If that's the case, I just need advice about how to figure out who can help with any given issue.)"

2,I'm losing my patience We don't have to agree or get along at all. I have my view points and my term of reference I like to use and you guys have yours. I've had my fill of certain users constantly getting at me in the comments. If you don't like me or agree with my goals. Fine whatever. Whether I'm winning or losing in life in life. I can do it with or without you. As a sufferer of PTSD the one thing I had to learn was whether or not to engage. Some people love to be miserable and dictate to others. Some people do not. But enough is enough. I'm done and I'm moving on from any discussion over my ambitions. 
2,"BCBS insurance is screwing us in 2019 I really just need to vent about how livid I am with my Blue Cross (PPO) insurance. 

I was informed today that my psych doctor - who has been amazing and so helpful in getting my PTSD under control - will no longer be able to accept BCBS insurance. 

Why, might you ask? 

Because someone thought it was a bright idea to make each and every psychiatric visit (even my follow ups for medication refills) require preauthorization with the turn of the new year. And for smaller offices, it’s completely unreasonable to call for preauthorization on every single visit. Just one preauthorization takes about 40 minutes. So my doctor is in an awful position of sending patients to new doctors or work out cash prices. 

This is crap. I pay hundreds of dollars a month for the luxury of heath insurance and in turn, my insurance is making it impossible to receive the healthcare I need. 

I am really looking forward to the day when mental health services are taken seriously. "
2,"How do you get the bad memories and past bullying out of your head? I saw a therapist a couple of months ago and the person said I have some trauma because I've been getting flashbacks from years of bullying by family members. I'm wondering how can I get this stuff out of my head and be normal? It just constantly takes me back to the past and I feel the same powerless/afraid feelings I did back then. I also can't get the face of the bully(s) and things they used to do to intimidate me while smirking and enjoying doing it.

I work as a nanny and work drains me so much and people never get it. My PTSD stems from multiple traumas but mostly my abuse and rape. And I’m sitting here trying to explain it and all I can come up with is:
“Babies are like men they don't understand personal space, they get handsy, and don't understand the word no.”
And it feels good to be able to put such a weird feeling into words.

2,"shoutout to anyone who struggled with new year fireworks Obviously, veterans are vulnerable to the fireworks, and I really wish more people would realize that. I literally live in a military town and the fireworks are nonstop. But personally, my neighbor shot himself this month and it really got to me. The fireworks have made me think about it a lot these past few days, and I've felt awful for his wife. Worse than the fireworks are the obnoxious amount of celebratory gunshots. Every time I hear one nearby, I think, ""hm, I wonder if that's what it sounded like when he did it. Why didn't I hear it?"" So, to the vets and anyone with trauma similar to mine, sorry about the fireworks and I hope you're doing okay. "

I was always kicked out of my house living at different cousins, aunts, and finally my grandmas house. One of my best friends died in my arms as I performed CPR on him waiting for the medics to arrive. I became a paramedic after that saying to myself I’m going to be better so nobody has to go through that. Turns out it’s really hard to save lives. I’m not going to go into calls I’ve ran or things I’ve seen. But friends and family always ask what’s the worst I’ve seen/done. Not realizing that to them it’s just a story but to us we relive it. It makes me just want to be alone. But at the same time I want to have friends. It’s weird. Is that a form of PTSD. I’m sorry I’m super new and don’t know how this works.

2,"Boyfriends Mother Insult-Re-traumatized I’ve only met my boyfriend’s mother 2-3 time over the 3 years me boyfriend and I have been together. I have ptsd from being abused from a former partner, including 2 incidents where I was almost killed. My boyfriend knows about my ptsd.  He went to visit his parents over Christmas.  We ended up getting in a fight. Unbeknownst to me, he apparently shares a lot with his mother.  ...Just not my ptsd history.  I was stunned when his mother, who has texted me only once ever, texted me to say “There are no words to describe you.  You’re a piece of work.  There’s a word for it Bipolar Disorder”.   While I don’t have anything negative about someone being bipolar, I do not have that diagnosis. She clearly thought this was an insult.  I haven’t responded to her, and don’t think I will.  My concern is that my boyfriend clearly never shared my ptsd or trauma history with her, but must have told her a lot more things about me for her to text me something like this.   ...I’m left with a ptsd episode worse than I’ve had in years. My boyfriend and I made up, or so I thought.  I haven’t been able to work since the holidays.  He’s vague about what his mother said, only indicating she was really upset that I was hurting him.  As anyone with ptsd knows, yes, I didn’t pull any punches in the messages during the fight. But, he apparently shared everything with her(btw, he said some pretty crappy things too).   I don’t know why Im posting. I’ve never done this before.  I guess I’m lost.  My boyfriend never took the time to understand ptsd symptoms?  I don’t feel like I can ever see or talk to his mom again...Our relationship must be over..  Maybe someone has some thoughts.  Should I confront his mother????"
2,"My therapist is proud of me. About a week ago I posted on r/AMA as a survivor of child sexual abuse. After the last therapy session, I was thinking what I can do as my therapist said. And I got an idea that by speaking about my experience I may be able to help myself to move on and also give courage to other kids who are in similar situations to ask adults for help. So I did AMA for it.

Facing about my trauma was harder than I thought. It made me so sick and feel uncomfortable, and I was getting worse than ever in past few months. I had really bad nightmares for the first time in a while. When I got panic attack in school few weeks ago I was like it’s pretty bad and I got worse again but this time was worse. 

Well, it was not only bad things. Actually it helped me a lot to move on and also I possibly could actually helped other kids from similar situations! I had this year’s first therapy session today and told about it to my therapist and she said what I did is really amazing and it’s not everyone can do. Also she is really proud of me! Now I feel god and proud of myself too."
2,"Reaction / Anxiety as-if I'm a young boy. Mindfulness to counter act / accept? NSFW Trigger I grew up with an alcoholic father that would beat mother. When I was in my teens I had to fight him make him stop. I'm not a person that likes to fight, not my thing but had no choice. As kids my sisters and I would tackle him to the floor. This could be anytime of the night, no telling when he would explode.

Now in my late 40's I still have instant sense of dread if I thing my boss is pissed, or someone is angry or slamming something.

The fight, flight, freeze response kicks in and a flood of anxiety and brain foq.

I have working more so now on acceptance of the feelings instead of pushing those down, still I find my inclination to thing WTF is wrong with me (I know the cause) and want to battle these emotions and get them out of my life.

2,"Meaningless Bad Day Well... I can't promise this will stay short, but I'll try.

Unrelated to PTSD, I hate noise and crowds. Anxiety disorder and all that. Well, this new years my house was filled with bunches of drunk, loud people. For 6 days straight.

Thankfully, one was my partner, who helped me stay in quiet spots and stay calm. But after 6 days I was super sleep deprived, especially because I've still been working full time through the holidays.

Last night I had my first good night sleep. And now this morning I feel awful. There were no triggers or anything. But my anxiety is through the roof, I'm freezing cold in a warm room, even my sensory processing is bad today.

Things just feel bad, and I have no reason why."

She shows a lot of those symptoms like anxiety, panic attacks, tensed up muscles, stress, depression... She has this feeling for more than 10 years but last 3 years it got worse. All of this happened because of many traumatic things that happened to her in her life

I love my mom so much. She is without questioning the most important person in my life. But it really breaks my heart seeing her like this. She has been to many therapists but they don't really seem to help her. The thing with my mom is she understands that all the things that happened to her in the past are things that are just so unfair but are things that sometimes are part of life (how bad it could be). She is just really depressed because that feeling of anxiety and constant stress won't go away. She is always tensed up and no doctor can do anything about it. She take anti-depressants and they help her a little bit.

I'm clueless, I don't know what to do and how I can help her. Has anyone here got some advice for me? Does ptsd get better? I would really appreciate it. Thank you"
2,"Does it ever get better?? And when I say “it” I mean the nightmares, flashbacks, the isolation, the constant anxiety. I mean *all* of it. Does PTSD ever get better?? 

My incident probably wasn’t even that traumatic but I still have fits and panic attacks and flashbacks and oh my! I just need to know one day I’ll never be reminded of that time. That I won’t sleep deprive myself because I’m so scared of falling asleep because the nightmares are so horrible. I refuse to go to a therapist and “talk it out” or seek some mental help because those were *massive* factors in what happened. The whole thing is barely a year old, but it feels like it’s everyday now. That I can’t escape it. Does time actually heal all wounds? Can the mind eventually get over it, make it less important? Or do I get stuck with it? Ta.

As soon as I remember the trauma (even though I am depersonalised) I feel panic and a sick feeling in my stomach. It’s like I want to change the way things happen. But I’m stuck in the frozen place of disbelief and rejection. 

My question is, how can moving your eyes ever make a horrible memory that still is unsettling, go away? How do you feel peace from that?

So, do y’all have any criteria or anything for when you think it’s appropriate to share with someone your trauma?

I’m so terrified to even sleep as I feel like life just hits the fan when I’m asleep. The feeling when you get that call and the words leading up. You just don’t know who it’s going to be this time or what happened. It’s so awful. I’m just really struggling. I know it may sound silly to some.

2,"How do I recover without becoming a predator? When I was 8 my cousin made me let him suck my penis, and then forced me to suck his. I was horrified, nauseous, and confused. The worst was that I felt guilty for not wanting to do it, and ultimately relented, consented, and instantly regretted it, even before it even started. I was trapped. I could not tell anyone because I would not be believed, and I would have gotten in trouble for participating. 

I’ve avoided thinking about it for 35 years. I have never written the words until now. 

In my life, I have rarely initiated sex, and can usually only get or maintain an erection when I an 100% convinced my partner is interested. If I believe my partner is participation ng mostly just for me I am physically unable to continue.

I have occasionally misperceved disinterest which ended the encounter. I have never been interested in recieving oral sex. This has not been a problem with any of my partners. Most were glad, and a few were indifferent but willing. 

I would like to overcome my aversion to recieving oral sex, but would be unable to complete the act if I felt like they were doing it just for me.

Not sure where else to talk about this at this point so I made a throwaway. Basically, a stranger completely misread a situation on social media which lead to them imply I had never been sexually assaulted. This lead to me having a complete meltdown and being triggered in a way I haven’t been in years. 

The mutual friend who made the post where the incident occurred told me several people have talked to the stranger and explained why this was wrong and inappropriate. I was then told that this person was autistic, so that’s why they misread the situation. I asked if they understood that what was said was wrong and hurtful...the answer was essentially “not really.” 

I’ll admit I’m not well versed in autism but I still feel like this person is kind of shitty for refusing to budge even after others explained to them that they were wrong. my friends don’t agree but say I’m allowed to be upset. So I’m still feeling fucking awful about the whole thing, and now I feel like my friends think I’m asshole for not fully letting this person off the hook.

Sorry if this is frazzled, I don’t even know what to do right now. So, I’ve been struggling with PTSD since 2016. My situation is so weird. I was groomed and repeatedly raped about 3x a week for about three months when I was 16 by a 25yr old WHO LIVED IN MY HOUSE. he was a friend of my stepdad’s, and he spent the entire time in my house taking advantage of then 15 year old me and deluding me into believing we were in a “relationship”. 

I’m in therapy now, and in the process of getting him arrested. Therapy has been helping a lot, and my symptoms were subsiding. I could sleep without nightmares. I could have sex without stopping to have a panic attack. I had my first meeting with the police Wednesday, and I was in a “Crimes Against Children” unit. I hate that it even exists. They told me they’re going to charge him with the most serious sex crime in my state, and it has a minimum sentence of 25 years. I also learned that he is somewhere in Europe, and that the day before my meeting, he got engaged. 

And then it all came back. I tried to have sex, and broke down crying. I haven’t slept more than a nap since the meeting. I feel so much guilt and shame. I don’t know what to do. How do you even survive the court system? How do you deal with the guilt?

I am learning and am hoping other sufferers may be able to share their insight and experience with me so I can continue to learn. 

We went to a hockey game last night and I asked if that would be too much, with the lights and noise. He said no, but I could tell he was tense. Afterward, we got in the car and he was clearly agitated and was yelling at me and when I tried to respond calmly and rationally, he kept saying, ""Whatever. Who cares."" He does this a lot when he's angry - the who cares bit.   


My questions are:  


Should I simply avoid all loud, crowded places even if he says it's okay? I don't want to make his choices for him.   
Is being angry after being overstimulated common? 

Has anyone else ever responded with ""Who cares"" during a time of fight/flight? Is that a reaction of being overwhelmed?

I could further describe, but for the sake of my triggers and for others I won’t get into it. I’ve been going to therapy and I was diagnosed with acute PTSD- meaning my symptoms are short term.

lm 18 years old. I pulled over to save this woman. If I hadn’t, I wouldn’t have nightmares, I wouldn’t have lost any sleep, I wouldn’t have this loss of motivation and the awful flashbacks, anxiety and guilt. I wouldn’t have nearly failed my psychology and forensics classes because of how triggering they were. 

Every time I close my eyes I can go back there and relive everything. I’d like to think if i had to do it all over again I would- to potentially save somebody’s life (we never found out if she is alive/dead)- but apart of me also would want to keep driving like everybody else. Does that make me a bad person?"
2,"Not PTSD because my trauma doesn't fit DSM-V Has anyone else experienced this? I was given a diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder instead of PTSD because my trauma (ongoing domestic violence, not involving threat to my life) didn't fit the new PTSD criteria. 

What am I supposed to do? I can't get the right counseling or therapy with a BPD diagnosis. It's like breaking your wrist and being told you need to see a chiropractor. 

Anyone else experience this? What have you done?"
2,"Do I have mild ptsd? My story doesn’t even come close to some of your stories... but I’m a 16 year old female and last year, I witnessed my dad’s heart attack in front of my eyes. It was a very traumatic, stressful event. It was incredibly serious and he actually lost his pulse and miraculously in the hospital (the doctor herself stated he was really lucky) they got his pulse back. Watching my dad die in front of my eyes, hearing the police shouting at each other, my mom going into complete hysterics, I think it’s given me a mild form of PTSD. 

My biggest regret is that I didn’t go to the hospital when he had the heart attack because I was in such a bad state of shock. It was an incredibly selfish thing of me to do and I despise myself for it. I refuse to forgive myself for making that choice. 

Also, a week after he could leave the hospital, I had nightmares about him having another heart attack but not being able to get to the hospital in time. I also couldn’t stop putting my fingers on my pulse to make sure my heart was still beating. Even thought it’s been a year, I don’t think there’s been a week where  I don’t remember it and then have a breakdown. And I don’t WANT to remember but my brain just won’t stop remembering it. My heart (and weirdly, this only happened after the heart attack) has been a skipping a beat more frequently. I can feel it throughout the day or when I exercise and it makes me scared but I don’t know if I’m just being paranoid. 

My depression and anxiety has also increased and I either sleep too little or sleep too much. My stress levels are also very high. And whenever my dad so much as sneezes or coughs, I get scared he’s going to die for good (I think it’s because when the heart attack happened, I watched him lunge forward, make this inhumane noise, and then just drop dead)

Even while I’m typing this, I’m ultra aware of my heart and its beats. And when someone talks about anything heart related, I visibly cringe and feel sick. 

I feel stupid for feeling this stuff over something as small as a heart attack (especially considering others have had much much more traumatic experiences) but I think the fact that I was 15 and young might’ve made it worse? Do you think I have ptsd? "
2,"Does anybody else struggle with not remembering their trauma? I have very few conscious memories of my earliest childhood traumas, but my _body_ remembers it. I remember smells, textures, sensations, but few images, no narrative, no order of events. The myriad evidence that anything bad happened is circumstantial, but I _do_ remember enough to know I was violated, and I am definitely trigger-able. It’s almost irrelevant whether or not the trauma occurred, because regardless of what events transpired, I am left with all the trappings of PTSD.

Why, then, am I so consumed and guilt-riddled by my lack of specific memory? Why do I feel like I’m a terrible human being for suspecting the worst of my caregiver? Like even if it _did_ happen, it absolutely _must_ have been my fault for “misunderstanding” things? Like if only I knew _for sure_, why, then... Then I could argue to myself why my feelings are _differently_ illegitimate, and it’s all still my fault, with the added bonus of perpetual nightmare fuel?... I do NOT want to remember it, but at the same time, it feels invalid if I don’t.

I know there are many flavors of misery to be had with this illness, but if there’s anybody out there in a similar boat, if you have found a way to cope with crippling guilt and shame caused by absent memories, please share what has helped you. I would love to feel a little less alone.

Thank you very much for reading, and I hope all of you out there find some manner of joy in your lives today."
2,"PTSD sucks [TW] I know I’m preaching to the choir here. But it really does.

How can I make it better? I need better strategies for overcoming this. It’s taking up so much of my time and thoughts. 

I just want to feel like myself, to feel like I can move forward and leave it behind. 

I’ve spent all weekend barely able to get out of bed, having really bad flashbacks and when I eventually get some sleep, nightmares.

I’ve got a counsellor, which is great, but she keeps cancelling our sessions. She’s cancelled 5weeks out of 9, so it’s all a bit sporadic.

I’m trying so hard. To keep going. To go to uni, keep on top of my work. To look after my family. To be a good friend and girlfriend. 

But sometimes it feels inescapable. 

Recently I keep wanting to take Codeine,  just because it feels nice for a bit. I’ve only done it a few times and I’ve never taken too many. But that’s not the point. I shouldn’t need to be doing it at all.

I’m worried as well that I keep getting suicidal. And when I do it seems so rational. I don’t want to end up doing something stupid on the spur of the moment just because it seems like a good idea. 

When it passes I’m always so glad I didn’t do anything.

But I also never tell anyone when I get like that. I don’t want them to worry about me. Or think I’m being over dramatic or saying it for attention.

My ex used to use suicide threats as a way to control me. I never want to make anyone feel like that. 


I don’t know why I’m writing this. 

I just want to feel better please, pretty, pretty please. "
2,"I was in a car accident and now I have this weird thing happening to me at intersections I’m just posting this because I need to tell someone and I feel like no one really understands my ptsd and I actually don’t exactly understand what’s happening to me in specific situations, when sometimes stopped at a red light. 
I was in a car accident over a year ago where my car was t-boned at an intersection. I broke my pelvis in four places, a rib, and had a brain bleed. The most significant, long lasting affect of the accident is the ptsd I have now. I have road rage, and at almost every intersection I pass it’s very scary for me and I often will cry out. I feel pathetic because I’m 26 years old and even with friends in the car with me I’ll cry out in fear uncontrollably. Most of the time in the car I’m a little on edge but am fine, but when crossing intersections or if I feel another driver is acting recklessly near me I’ll get very upset. 
I have this one very weird thing happen to me when I am sitting at a red light. It happens sometimes but yesterday was the most severe, as I happened to get stopped on a red light at the same intersection where the accident was, it’s in a town over from where I live now and I avoid the area so I am not over there much.
Anyways so when I am sitting at the red light, I start to feel very woozy, and I start to feel like I’m leaving my body or losing control of my body. I can’t tell if I’m passing out or what exactly is happening but it’s frightening and I’m afraid I’ll lose consciousness. I’ll usually try to shake my head and kind of wake myself up or open a window, and by the time the light turns green and I can go again then it will pass and it will go away. Sometimes when I stop the car on red the episode will start where I feel like the car is still moving even though it’s not and I’ll press extra hard on the brake and realize I’m not actually moving, then the sickness/pass out feeling starts. Does this happen to anyone else? "
2,"I keep having flashback dreams of my assault and it’s making it harder to get over ptsd About two years ago I was sexually assaulted and in an abusive relationship, and since then I’ve been able to get on with my life and try and recover. My ptsd is still there but it’s getting better, but I keep having these vivid dreams of my attack or just with my assaulter in them and it’s making it extra hard to get over."
2,"I think I just relived my trauma and made everything worse. (Triggers sexual assault/drinking) So over a year ago I attended a party with a bunch of friends and got very drunk with them. My boyfriend at the time was also very drunk. Towards the end of the night we got into an extremely bad fight that led to him trying to force me to have sex with him. Luckily it didn’t end up happening and I went home but the night was so traumatic for me that it led to intense anxiety and panic attacks as well as nightmares and depression. 

Fast forward to today. I went to another party with a friend of mine who has had a crush on me for a long time. I’ve denied him multiple times and went into the reasoning why despite knowing that I shouldn’t have to give a reason. He didn’t give up and kept pursuing me anyway. At a previous party while drunk he began making out with me and touching me. I was conscious enough to understand where it was going so I stopped him and said I didn’t want to do this with him and that this was wrong. He left. Last night we had another party and I got extremely drunk on accident(alcohol count on the drink was higher than I thought) so I ended up laying on my friends bed. He came in and ended up making out with me. I was barely conscious at the time and can’t remember what all happened other than feeling some pain and a lot of numbness. The next day he texted me and I told him I didn’t remember what happened. He told me in detail everything and that we had started having sex but he had to stop for some reason. My body is incredibly sore now and I’m just in a lot of mental pain. I don’t understand why I did this to myself. I never should’ve gone to this party or drank alcohol around my friends. I should’ve been able to trust him not to take advantage of me and at least to feel bad. Since then he’s been texting me asking when we’re going to do this again and wanting to see what else I can do. And I’ve been ignoring the messages. Why doesn’t he realize I DONT want him?!?! Why does he constantly pursue me? Why couldn’t he realize I was DRUNK and DIDNT ACTUALLY WANT THAT? I don’t know what to do I feel the panic coming back and the anxiety all over again. I feel sick to my stomach and my body is a constant reminder of what happened. "
2,"Names? Do any of y'all find it very intrusive when people call you by name?

I don't know how to explain it, but when someone uses my name I feel very awkward and vulnerable. I feel the same calling some else by their name. It feels like an invasion of privacy and I'm not sure why. 

Just wondering if anyone can relate? "
2,"My accident stole a huge chunk of my identity, but not for long My accident ended my culinary career.

I feel like it stripped a huge chunk of my identity from me. When you meet people, they generally ask what you do in the first few questions. After the accident, I no longer had an answer.

Monday, I start college for the first time. I can no longer say, I run banquets, or I'm a chef, or I cook, but I can say I am a fulltime student.

It doesn't fill the whole gap, but it's a start. It doesn't magically fix anything, but it's one step &amp; I hope that step is in the right direction.

2,"I need to talk about last night someplace. Guess it's here. Trigger warning: Rape, break in, violence

I had a nightmare last night.

I was in my room, reading a book. I hear glass shatter, and the alarm goes off (my house has a fucking anxiety-inducing alarm system). My book disappears and I look outside of my room, terrified. Before I can see into the hall, I'm shoved back onto my bed, and this big man, easily double my size, looms over me. I scream out, before he spreads me legs and begins to rub on me. Behind him, my mother just,,, *stares.* Her expression blank and cold, I remember that much. The man shoves my face back up to look right at him as I feel the pain in my stomach. Ah fuck the *pain.* It felt so fucking real. I passed out from it, and woke up tightly hugging my pillow. I've been thinking about it all day, it's been the most real dream of the past month. I'm afraid to fall asleep again.

I didn't wake up sweating, or hot, or gasping for air this time though. I was just,, dead silent. 

Thanks for the vent."
2,"The new mission They label it
Diagnose it
Treat it
It makes it worse

3 tours in Iraq, tortured, drowned to death and resuscitate. I fond memories of, a cherished blur of adrenaline.

But it's not real.
We chase that numbness, that elusive shadow of something you can't name.

Escaping into it becomes a daily response mechanism to conflict. Drowning out the outside noise with the noise inside our heads.

But it's not real.
Your family is real, your friends are real, your future is real; you are real.

We approach issues as problems and launch missions. We push forward to win the fight; but it's not a fight; there is no battle outside, only one within.

The new mission isn't one of conflict. It's a mission of serenity, patience, and love.
If you are struggling, just let go. Your life is your karma and you have a lot more to give.

If you are reading this, stop what you are doing, stop what you are thinking. Make your loved ones feel important. 
Your wife should wake up to a path of flowers leading to a card thanking her for everything she's done. 
Your kids should enjoy a breakfast out where you leave your phone in the car, or even at home.
They are real, they are important.

I live in a glass house and see my family two days a week, I stayed in the blur for too long.
Things aren't too late to change until they are.
The new mission is love.

Gitr done"
2,"Where would I post a garbled backstory? I'm pretty sure I've been living with undiagnosed PTSD for about 14 years, and while I'm trying to get the nerve to do something concrete about it, I have an incredibly hard time putting everything into words/making what happened and is happening coherent. A good friend suggested I just word vomit it all out on a forum somewhere anonymously and get used to talking about it in a way that isn't personal. Is this a place to do that, or is there a better sub for that kind of thing?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you in advance, and sorry if this is the wrong place!"
2,How on earth do you tell if someone is gaslighting you if your memory is shot from ptsd? It’s doing my head in....
2,"Validated in my ptsd and my ideas for its source by an awesome psych. But... Hi. First, background: FTP with no clue about formatting because usually I'm on mobile. I'm mid-20s, AFAB nonbinary, American, shitty family situation that I'm 6months out of. Some of that shitty situation involves abuse and more manipulation than I care to think about. I was initially dx'd with ptsd and general anxiety in 2016, following a house fire (only lost the kitchen, thankfully, but it was at 2am and *traumatic as hell*.) and 3-4 months of recurring panic attacks. Recurring being between once and twice a week.

Fastforward through some more abuse and shitty stuff to now. I'm employed, work with good people in a loud environment. I have panic attacks on a near-weekly basis, usually with no obvs trigger, and the results vary from ""I need to go collect myself outside for as long as I can hold off the misplaced guilt for being *broken* and *holding my coworkers back*"" to ""I cannot do this and I need to go home *right now*.""

I'm seeing a great psychologist, specializes in ptsd and has been awesome in helping me ground and figure out causes and such, but insurance doesn't cover therapy (apparently) and unfortunately $110 a visit is a bit steep.

I don't want to go back on meds, they didn't help as much as I needed them to. Dulled the edge, but didn't stop the knives in my mind and in my gut enough for me to function.

I know I have PTSD and probably major depression. I suspect I might have cPTSD (the descriptions and discussions in those communities strike a little too close to home for it to be coincidence). I'm an obligate night owl in a crack-o-dawn position (thus perma-jetlag which I know doesn't help) with no interviews or alternate jobs on the horizon, and I'm getting to the end of my rope. I have very few contacts where I am now, and going to any of the places I used to be is a very bad idea for me. What more can I do?"
2,"Got a final Exam on Friday, shaking with worry I'm in pretty deep in the whole PTSD thing. High TES, High Anxiety, High Depression. 

Last time I had a University exam I blew my lid and had a ton of flashbacks during, granted I was just uncovering the extent at the time after repressing it for 6 months. 

I'm worried it's going to happen again. 
Studying is already difficult, I barely get sleep, can't concentrate, when I do I just stare at a page.

The rational part of me knows I'll have tried my best fail or don't every single day is a fight. I take my pills, go to the gym, clean, practice hygiene, attend classes. 

I can handle failure, if I dropped put I could find some peace working the lowest job, eventually find my place. 

These Grey areas terrify me. I can't deal with them. 
What do?

 "
2,"I couldn't help it ... what if the abuser couldn't either? My dad was abusive towards my mom, and I have PTSD because of it. As a result, I have had to come to terms with the fact that my actions towards men are sometimes downright hurtful. For example, shutting down emotionally (a switch flips), physically pushing someone away for no reason, rejecting people after a long time spent building up trust. I hate that I do this - I admittedly have sabatoged my own relationships.

My question is.. after doing this, my explanation is that ""I genuinely couldn't help it."" The part of me that acts out of PTSD doesn't feel like me. It's hard for me to feel responsible for ""her"" actions, because sometimes in that state of mind i'd have disassociated. I know that I have taken certain harmful actions but all without consciously deciding or meaning to.

Of course, I have not done anything physically harmful or directly abusive to another person. My actions do not compare to the way my dad treated my mom. But when I hear my own justifications, I can't help but think, what if my dad couldn't help
it to??

Does anyone relate? I know this kind of reasoning is flawed, but it also scares a part of me."
2,"Invasive flashbacks after car accident. Help! Hey all. 

New redditor here, sorry if this is in the wrong place. 4 months ago I fell asleep on the motorway and ironically hit an accident that had just happened (overworked, wasn’t drunk or on my phone). Fortunately nobody besides me was hurt. When the police saw the state of my car/me they said they couldn’t believe I was alive. I got a new car pretty swiftly and started driving again And I’m not scared of driving. But atleast 8 times a day I’ll be doing something such as the gym or reading and suddenly I’m flashing back to hitting the car in front and being whacked with an airbag. I find myself losing track of conversations and lying in bed thinking about it. Does it go away in time. "

**Affiliation**: None, as this is for a paper.

**Target group**: PTSD Sufferers, Others.

**Compensation**: None, besides knowledge and maybe a decent grade.

**Background**: Chose to do my Psych semester test over PTSD because I was ignorant, and thought PTSD was cool because I saw it in action movies. After a bit of research and reading here, I realize I was in the wrong.

\- (Can it be treated?) 

\- (How can it be treated) 

\- (More in-depth analysis) 

\- (What the Future looks like) 

\- (What can we do now) 

\- (Do you know anyone with PTSD) 

\- (What should you do for them)

2,"Working with my therapist has helped me approach my trauma but for the past week now, rumination and flashbacks have been occurring more. Is this part of the process? Kinda like I'm facing my demons? The flashbacks and rumination have been lowering in intensity but now I feel they're happening more often when before, they'd rarely come up. There are a lot of things that will take time like subconscious learned behavioues. I've just been having a hard time. Trying not to let it send me into a depressive episode but it's hard when it just hits me. Or not even memories but I catch myself doing a certain behaviour or thinking in a certain way that happened because of it. It's scary and uncomfortable. My therapist isn't forcing it either, it's just something that our sessions has lead into to start addressing. It's just hard living like this, knowing I have all of these behaviours and thought processes because of it and they won't go overnight. I'm so impatient. I can't talk to anyone other than my therapist too and its hard.

Am I at least on the right track? Is it normal to experience symptoms like this when trying to recover? I dunno. I guess I need some reassurance."
2,"Triggered by my partner's instability and insomnia I have posted on here before, mostly rants/seeking support, validation. I guess here I am looking for advice today.  


I have C-PTSD, and I have literally spent the last year overhauling my mental health. Seeing a therapist, being more open about my feelings, and I have put a ton of effort into getting my nervous to calm TF down. The New Year has emerged, and I am feeling like I am more function than I have been in a few years.  
Meanwhile, my partner of over 5 years has struggled with anxiety all her life. This has included bouts of extreme insomnia. In the past she tried blaming me for my snoring, so we got a separate room set up for her. I was framed as so much of the problem until it was inescapable that its really her and her anxiety. So we have 3 beds in our house plus a double foamie. When she sleeps in the same room as me she sleeps in one of the two queen beds we have in just our bedroom. I sometimes joke that we are like the Flintstones from the prudish age of TV.  


So yeah, she works shift work and while she is not considered full-time permanent she gets part-time hours. I have my own online business which I have neglected but slowly grown over the past year. Because of my improved health I have been eager to work on my career and business. However, this week she has had a canceled shift which led to her taking an overnight shift (11pm to 7am) which was a TERRIBLE idea, she consented to all this before talking to me about it. Which would be fine if I didn't have to put out her fires and basically become totally responsible for her mental health as a consequence. I feel like a babysitter...  


So it was: night shift 3pm - 11pm, followed by a 11pm - 7am, followed by 3pm to 11pm, followed by 7am to 3pm. She did not sleep at all since she picked up the overnight shift. We had a talk about this pattern of anxiety and insomnia of hers, and that went well. Until she woke me up at 1am last night, SCREAMING AT ME that she hadn't slept at all. Now, as a lot of you can probably relate to, getting woken up by being screamed at for something you have zero control over is an absolute trigger. I burst out in tears, the kind where you just feel your soul pouring out because you are powerless but so much is expected of you. She went to the other room and I don't know what happened, she did go to work and texted me later she was sorry.  


Now I am left alone, feeling very resentful of all the effort I put into helping her from keeping the home clean, to trying ti stay up with her. I had shaken this disgusting feeling of anxiety, depression, and sadness that lives in my gut but it has returned after last night. It really pisses me off because I LITERALLY just got out of this cycle and I am trying to get myself into a sensible routine. But I do feel angry about this. She texted me today that she will see the doctor after work. I really don't know what to do with all this. Today I feel like I really don't want to be around her so I am writing this at my local library. I don't really have any friends or family to console with because I live in a big city several hours from my hometown.   


Anyone have any advice for how to deal with this? When your mental health is a full time job just for your partner to be such a trigger.  


I want to add that our relationship is usually pretty great. This issue definitely rears its ugly head from time to time. I feel like someone has hit the disable button on me (like...her) and I feel working on myself getting ahead is not an option anymore. It really makes me wonder if there is a solution to this or if I am just to let go of all my goals until she can just be a little more stable....help"
2,"Here I go. Wish me luck. A few months ago I quit my job due to the triggers and apparent similarity to the original cause for my PTSD. The downside was that I lost the best therapist I have ever met (and any sort of steady income). Today, I start a new job in a similar field but it shouldn't have the same triggers or environment. I'll be gaining back medical benefits that will allow me to see my therapist again. 

I still suffer, I still have episodes, and I'm nowhere near being done with this shit. But, I feel stronger, and that progress feels good. Like a new PR in lifting or something. I can confidently say I'm excited to go back to work, not scared or worried. I like this feeling, I'm gonna try to remember this the next time I start spiraling before an episode.

I've basically become agoraphobic and incredibly anxious and neurotic plus loads of other head chaos but I found it easier telling myself it was just anxiety and not really relating it to a real situation/person because it now feels really real.

I got diagnosed this morning and I'll now be doing a ""ptsd stabilisation course"" and then therapy. Do you have any tips for dealing with it? I don't want to waste this chance to move on but I really really cannot imagine really talking about it.

2,"211 operator looking for advice on how to comfort PTSD victims For some background, I spoke to a veteran the other day at work and realized our resources at work had very little on how to speak to people with PTSD, veterans or not. I got approval to create a file specifically for educating my coworkers and myself on the subject and while I've done a couple hours research, I would love some firsthand feedback.

What are some things we should do when you tell us what you're going through?

What is the best thing we can say to you?

What are some things NEVER to say to someone with PTSD?

What are some things that help you get through an episode or flashback?

Do you find that simply having someone to listen to you helps?

I'm now 5 years down the road and some recent events have led to me seeking therapy again (new person). Problem is I find myself literally unable to speak in sessions. I feel really rude - I'm responding to everything she says or asks in my head, but I can't verbalize a damn thing. We just sit there in silence with me super keyed up. 

She mentioned today maybe trying art therapy. My first thought is I suck at art, but to be fair I have no idea what that really involves.

I have Premera Blue Cross that will cover treatment. I also have rich parents who will do anything at this point to keep me alive. I have a rich socialist boyfriend who wants me to stop trying to break up with him and stop feeling so much pain. 

I have been sober since 2016 but I don't go to AA. 

Any leads in a sunny area? Literally anywhere in the world for any price? Okay with hippy/white lady bullshit, just need it to be güd. "
2,"I wish there was a way to feel like less of a target. I saw a video on reddit that made me worry for myself. I’m a short girl(20) and though I have a pretty strong Resting Bitch Face, I’m terrified someone will try to kidnap me or something(grew up with my parents always warning me of people doing that). And after all of the shit that’s already happened that I was unable to protect myself from, I’m afraid that in a situation like that I’d freeze up and not be able to scream or fight all over again. 

I’m afraid that i even look like a target. I don’t make eye contact with any males other than my family members/fiancé and i barely go out but when I do, I’m obviously anxious and I don’t talk. I just hope me looking like an utter bitch gets people to leave me alone. 

This is why I only go out if I’m with other people and I hold onto them/their clothes. 

Men scare me.  Women make me uneasy. 

Sorry about the venting. "
2,"First Date Jitters Hey friends!

&amp;#x200B;

***TL;DR***

*First date jitters are killing me, what are some things that have helped you calm yourself down from the neverending cycle of freaking out?*

&amp;#x200B;

It's been an entire year since I left the situation that gave me PTSD. 

I can say it's gotten way better in the past few months. My abusive ex passed away in September, so the reason for my stress is no longer a threat. I'd say it's a bit bittersweet. I wanted peace, but not like this. But such is life, ya know?

&amp;#x200B;

So I started dating again! I've been on a couple of duds, and canceled about a million more because of some internal gut instinct to flee. More often than not I talk myself into just staying home, because let's face it....it's easier to hide under our covers where it feels safe, and go about our lives without the potential stress of dating someone new (who we actually like. YIKES!) That just sounds complicated. And the last thing I want after last year is complicated.

&amp;#x200B;

BUT. I met this really great guy recently. We talked for a month and a half and are finally deciding to meet up for a date, and lemme tell ya. I'm terrified. I feel like I'm on the verge of a panic attack every time I think about it. 

I. want. to. puke. It's a mix of first date jitters and my past life creeping up on me all at the same time. 

&amp;#x200B;

And I think to myself, how will I ever be able to separate what happened to me, and my future with another person?

When I look at this really great guy, how will I not simultaneously think about how secretly evil and malicious people can be? What if he IS secretly malicious and evil, and I have to find out too late all over again?

I feel like a little child, and I hate being in this mindset. I don't want to feel like small and closed-in. I don't want to block potentially good things from happening to me.

&amp;#x200B;

People don't want broken people. And not that I'm broken, but I have some internal issues going on. 

&amp;#x200B;

What have you people done when starting to date again?"
2,"Issues at work, again. I work for an overall supportive company, and overall I enjoy my job and the work environment. At least, I did.... I have one coworker who will make off-color jokes, randomly yell about things that really should be handled calmly, make fun of people using the word “triggered”, etc. Several times I’ve had panic attacks at work and this person has tried to one-up me. Everyone in the office knows I have PTSD, so there isn’t any claim to ignorance here.

I don’t even know what to do, because I don’t want to make waves and because some of my coworkers go along with it and I don’t want to get anyone else in trouble. And I don’t even know if I’m just being overly sensitive because I’m okay with a relaxed work environment, but this is just...out of control and affecting my work performance. "
2,"How do I (21F) carry on? I’ve been dealing with PTSD since I was a young adult. It has worsened significantly since graduating high school after to being assaulted on more than one occasion. I pulled myself out of college for a year and a half and am just now getting back into it. Since then I have filled my time with work or isolating myself. I have no hobbies, hardly any friends and no idea how to open myself up to either. I am not sure if I have any interests or how to find any. I have no idea what to study or what I would even be slightly interested in, academically. I constantly fear abandonment and rejection. My PTSD has consumed me and made me into something small and weak. I am embarrassed by how jumpy I am, how I have a serious tremor and how I get very dark and scared very quickly. I do not want to live like this anymore. Therapy is not in the budget (yet) and I fear opening up to people due to the underlying causes of the PTSD. How do you carry on? How do I reclaim my life? Sorry this is kind of all over the place. 
TL;DR: 21F consumed by PTSD, needs advice on how to reclaim my life and find meaning.

2,"Ketamine infusions New here.  Has anyone had ketamine infusions for their PTSD symptoms?  If so, how helpful were they??  I'm desperate.  I've tried a dozen medications, EMDR, mediation, you name it.  Thanks in advance."
